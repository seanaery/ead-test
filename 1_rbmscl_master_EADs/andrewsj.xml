<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Photojournalist and regional documentary photographer Jesse Pyrant Andrews (b. 1949) is based in southern Virginia, and has photographed the changing rural landscapes of Virginia and North Carolina and the lives of its inhabitants since 1975.  His work includes photographs of buildings in small southeastern towns, landscapes from train windows, farms and rural farming communities.  Many of his photographs document the effects of the industrialization of tobacco farming on communities that once depended on tobacco as their economic base.  Andrews has also photographed Latino workers and has documented, with photographs and oral histories, the lives of disabled veterans.  He studied at the New England School of Photography in Boston, Massachusetts, working primarily with photographers Olive Pierce and George Dewolfe.  He shoots 35mm black-and-white film which he prints in his traditional wet darkroom.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The Jesse Pyrant Andrews Photographs collection consists of 149 gelatin silver black-and-white prints dating from 1973 to 2012, the majority of which document rural life in the Piedmont plateau of Virginia and North Carolina.  There is also one oral history associated with a print.  There are many portraits of farmers, their families, Latino workers, and other local people, and scenes from their homesteads and farms.  Themes include farming, tobacco cultivation, and tobacco auctions; activities such as music-making, dancing, hunting, tanning animal hides, and braiding leather; the lives and struggles of American war veterans; and the status of regional economies and small businesses in rural Virginia in the late 20th century.  Photographs from the series documenting tobacco farming, <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">13-Month Crop,</title> were selected for a 2002 exhibit of Andrew's work hosted by the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.</p>

<p>Two related bodies of documentary work whose images form part of the Virginia Photographs Series are the Disabled Veterans and the Carter-Wooding projects.  The first examines the lives and struggles of American war veterans and includes a recorded oral history of a vet.  The second documents the history of two families and their Virginia farm in Halifax County, which dates back to an original 18th-century land grant to the Carter family.  Additional projects in the collection include a series of images taken by Andrews from an Amtrak train during a trip from New York City to Lynchburg, Virginia, and street scenes and portraits of individuals taken in New York City, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Tennessee, and California; there are also several abstract images of plants and one of ice on a pond.</p>

<p>In many cases the photographs are accompanied by captions written by the photographer commenting on the individuals, their life histories, and aspects of regional or local culture. Original identification numbers and titles assigned by the photographer were retained and a Rubenstein Library id added.  Any titles in brackets were supplied by the archivist as additional description.  The original code on the back of the prints has also been retained that indicates series, negative file, and negative number, i.e.,  POR-3-47-9, meaning the Portrait Series, notebook 3, page 47, negative 9</p>

<p>Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

<p>Consists of 37 black-and-white, 11x14 inch prints exhibited at Duke University's Perkins Library, August 7-December 14, 2002.  Andrews spent a year photographing the people involved in cultivating tobacco on the Moore family farm in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, during one tobacco season, April 2000-April 2001.  Includes images of family members as well as Hispanic laborers. Tobacco farming is such labor-intensive work that it is often called a "13-month crop."  All titles and captions in this series were supplied by the photographer.  Original print numbers have been retained.  Arranged in original order as received.</p>

<p>Bill learned to braid leather when he was a child. His father did not want him to learn that craft so he would take the strands of leather under the covers of his bed at night and practice braiding simply by feel. He could do any sort of braid from the most simple to making what he called a <emph render="doublequote">rosette</emph>, a round knot woven from 16 strands of leather, seemingly with no beginning or end.</p>

<p>Bill was much older than Nancy. When she turned 18, she wanted to attend the nursing school at the University of Virginia, but their father refused to pay for her to go. Bill eventually saved enough money to send her and she graduated in 1941. She never returned to the farm except to visit and lived in Richmond until her death in 2005. This image was made during her last visit to see Bill.  She always referred to him as her <emph render="doublequote">angel</emph> and thus she was making a halo for him.</p>

They are all dead now, their farm sold and is now a high-end housing development. The Davis family was a real link to the past. They never got accustomed to the Twentieth Century.

<p><emph render="doublequote">Bill would tan fresh deer hides to use in his leather work. He made a device which would split a hide into evenly sized strips for braiding. He made belts, sashes, hat bands, watch fobs, key holders, and guitar straps. He also did harness repairs and remade worn out shoes. But the first step in this process was to pick all the flesh off the hide. If left, the bits of flesh would attract insects to eat the hide and leave uncured spots on the finished hide.</emph></p>

<p>These 31 11x14 inch images were taken by Jesse Andrews on November 19, 2010 using traditional black-and-white film during a train trip from New York City to Lynchburg, Virginia.  Images were chiefly taken from the windows of the moving train and capture overpasses, traffic, graffiti, residential neighborhoods, train stations, and other urban landscapes; a few shots focus on train passengers and there is one of a railroad worker on the tracks.</p>

<p><emph render="doublequote">Ed Wemple grew up in Charlottesville and graduated from the University of Virginia. He wandered the country during the depression of the 1930s. He worked as a longshoreman in New York, in lumber camps in Oregon and eventually went to Mexico, where he became a heroin addict. He cured himself by walking from El Paso to the Oklahoma border. He returned to New York, where he lived until 1964, taking in the bohemian and jazz cultures and working at odd jobs. He returned to Charlottesville in 1964 and lived there until his death in 1987. I lived in the same house with him for a year. He had not had a bath in nine years and spent his time reading and sleeping. He went by taxi once a week to the Alderman Library to replenish his book supply. A wonderful man who had endless stories to tell about his life. I regret that I did not record any of our conversations.</emph></p>

<p>Born Jan. 10, 1919 at Callands, Va.  Grew up on a tobacco farm, enlisted in the Army in 1941, fought as an infantryman through North Africa, then as a Ranger through the Sicilian and Italian campaigns.  Discharged November, 1945.  Wounded three times in what he called "three years of continuous combat." As a Ranger he was usually at the forward most front of the fighting.  He has suffered since his discharge with severe PTSD and alcoholism.  In spite of that, as well as his physical wounds, he was a successful tobacco farmer until he retired in 1994.  He lives on the same farm where he was born. Up to this time I have not been able to convince Mr. Aaron to agree to an oral history.  When I made this photograph, he said, "I was a nice fellow when this picture was made (the portrait of himself he is holding), before I went overseas.  Since then, I don't know, I just never have been the same." This is part of the Disabled Veterans series.

<p>Mrs. Maynard Amos operated Amos' General Store at Callands, Va. with her husband until he suffered a stroke in 1999.  Since then she has run the store on her own.  One of only a handful of such rural businesses still in operation, it remains a gathering place for local farmers and a source for gasoline, farm supplies, groceries, patent medicines, and just about anything else a person might need.
