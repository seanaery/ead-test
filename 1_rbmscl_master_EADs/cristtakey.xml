        personal and professional correspondence and subject files (1960s-early 1970s) documenting
        Crist's medical training, internship, residency, and then his position as Assistant
        Professor at UNC Chapel Hill, especially his involvement in increased access to therapeutic
        abortions and health services; the development of abortion techniques; and sex and

          <p>Addition (67 items, 7.3 linear ft.; undated) consists of 67 16mm films used by "Crist
            Clinic Audio Visuals" in health education programs (undated). The clinic also offered
            the films for sale or rent to educators, students, doctors, parents, and others. The
            majority of the films focus on sex education for children and teenagers. Topics include
            puberty and menstruation, sex and sexuality, sexual orientation, lifestyle choices, and
            sexually transmitted diseases. Other topics include abortion; pregnancy and childbirth;
            infant care and nutrition; marriage and parenting; and drug and alcohol abuse. Arranged
            in alphabetical order by title. Reels are individually numbered and are not boxed
            together but housed separately.</p>

          <p>Addition (13,125 items, 21.0 linear feet) contains subject files that chronicle the
            history of the Crist Clinic from the opening of the clinic in 1973 to the early 21st
            century. The majority of the files contain Takey Crist's clippings on medical topics and
            issues relating to sex education and women's health care. Many files also refer to
            issues of significance for physicians running a private clinic. </p>
