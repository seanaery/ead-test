			<head>Collection Overview</head>

			<p>The Frank Espada Papers and Photographs collection consists largely of photographic
				prints, contact sheets, proofs, and negatives, chiefly dating from the mid-1970s
				through 2010, relating to Espada's Puerto Rican Diaspora Documentary Project, his
				project work on indigenous Chamorro communities in Micronesia, primarily in Guam,
				Tinian, and Saipan, and his work documenting HIV/AIDS outreach and education in San
				Francisco. The largest body of materials, which includes photographs as well as
				manuscripts and recorded interviews, derives from Espada's work with the Puerto
				Rican communities which spanned several decades. A smaller group of materials,
				nineteen prints, associated contacts and negatives and several folders of documents,
				were created through Espada's activism in the Civil Rights Movement for voter
				registration and school desegregation in New York City from 1962-1970.</p>

			<p>Other materials include research files on documentary topics he was currently
				investigating; materials used in preparation for his many photography project
				exhibits, large and small; teaching syllabi and notes from his photography courses;
				awards and memorabilia; and other manuscript and printed materials from his career
				in photography.</p>

			<p>The photographic materials have been arranged in series according to format: <emph
					render="bold">Contact Sheets and Prints</emph>; <emph render="bold">Negatives;
					Loose Proofs; Manuscript Materials; Photographic Prints</emph>; and <emph
					render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph>. there is also an oversize materials
				grouping at the end of the collection.</p>

						<p>The photographs from the Puerto Rican Diaspora Documentary Project were

							image. Locations including California, Milwaukee, Hawaii, Puerto Rico,
							New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. Most locations

					<p>Espada's teaching career is documented in this series, which includes
						re-foldered class binders as well as evaluations, class rosters, handouts,
						and other course materials about photography. Original folder titles have
						been retained in most cases.</p>

					<p>Another large sub-series includes materials from the preparations and edits
						for Espada's book, <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Puerto Rican
							Diaspora: Themes in the Survival of a People</title>, which was
						published in 2006.</p>
					<p>The supporting documentation for the Puerto Rican Diaspora Documentary
						Project offers insight into the work done by Espada to win the grant from
						the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as the work he completed
						during the grant period through site visits, newsletters, and reports.
						Several folders relate to interviews, including some summaries, quotes, and
						transcripts. The audiocassette tapes for these interviews are a separate
						series in the collection. Another component of this subseries is the exhibit
						preparation and logistics: the project was exhibited in 45 venues over a 15
						year period. Finally, there is third-party supporting documentation about
						Puerto Rico and the various communities highlighted by Espada in the
						project.</p>

					<p>The Chamorro Documentary Project materials, dating 1989-1990, include
						information about the different locations photographed by Espada, as well as
						notebooks and exhibit materials.</p>

					<p>The remainder of the series includes some supporting documentation about some
						of Espada's other projects, including HIV/AIDS outreach, Civil Rights, and
						the Real Alternatives Program. Other materials honor Espada, including some
						city proclamations. </p>

					<p>Approximately 335 large black-and-white gelatin silver prints, many matted
						and signed by Frank Espada. Most prints relate to the Puerto Rican Diaspora
						Documentary Project and contain portraits of Puerto Rican communities in New
						York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Washington
						DC, and Puerto Rico itself. Other notable prints date from the Civil Rights
						Movement in 1963 and 1964, including voter registration drives, school
						boycotts, and the March on Washington; the Chamorro Documentary Project,
						with photographs from Guam in 1990; and Espada's documentation of HIV and
						drug use in San Francisco. Photographs include original descriptive
						titles.</p>

					<p>Prints have been boxed by size, with photographs grouped within boxes as best
						as possible by content (Puerto Rican Diaspora project materials have been
						sub-grouped by location, if possible). Prints are listed by the size of the
						box, which closely reflects the size of the print (15x19 prints are within a
						16x20 box, for example). Some prints were assigned a number by Espada as
						part of his internal documentation. These have been included when present on
