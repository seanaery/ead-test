<head>Historical Note</head>

<p>The Full Frame Documentary Film Festival is the largest film festival in the United States entirely devoted to documentary film.  An international event dedicated to the theatrical exhibition of non-fiction cinema, the Festival is held annually for four days in the spring in downtown Durham, North Carolina.  Typically, more than 100 films are screened, along with discussions, panels, and workshops fostering conversation between filmmakers, film professionals and the public.</p>

<p>Full Frame's mission, as stated in 2010, is to support the documentary form and community by showcasing the contemporary work of established and emerging filmmakers and by preserving film heritage through archival efforts and continued exhibition of classic documentaries. The organization is also committed to building wider national and international audiences for documentary film and enhancing public understanding and appreciation of the art form and its significance.</p>

<p>Originally named the DoubleTake Documentary Film Festival, it was launched in 1998 under the leadership of Nancy Buirski, in association with the Center for Documentary Studies (CDS) at Duke University and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">DoubleTake</title> Magazine, an acclaimed journal published by CDS from 1995-1998. Buirski expressed the Festival's mission that year as "to see documentary films take their rightful place in the pantheon of film festivals and in the hearts of film lovers" (Festival Program 1998).  She described its uniqueness as lying "in its focus on film content, its emphasis on issues that matter, and its ability to reach out to the community and act as a bridge to its concerns" (<emph render="italic">ibid.</emph>)</p>

<p><title render="italic" linktype="simple">DoubleTake </title>Magazine ceased to be associated with the festival after 1999, and from 2000 on, the Festival was presented by Documentary Arts, Inc. (a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by Nancy Buirski and later renamed Doc Arts, Inc.), in association with the CDS.  The festival was renamed "Full Frame Documentary Film Festival" for the 2002 festival.  Duke University withdrew as a presenting sponsor from 2003 through 2005.  <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The New York Times</title> joined as a presenting sponsor from 2003 through 2008 festival.  From 2006 to 2010, Duke University returned as presenting sponsor.  In the fall of 2010, Full Frame became once again a program of the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. The festival also receives support from a large number of corporate sponsors, private foundations and individual donors.</p>

<p>Each year, a series or thematic program is foregrounded, curated by established filmmakers.  In addition, there has usually been one or two "sidebar" series presented, one of which focuses on the American South.  The bulk of the programming, however, has always been devoted to new documentaries in competition; a selection committee consisting of local volunteer professionals chooses a few dozen films for screening, considering original content and technical proficiency primarily, from a pool of 100 to 1000 submissions from filmmakers from around the world.  Several awards are then given at the conclusion of the Festival; the Grand Jury and Audience Awards have been awarded every year, and additional awards have been added from year to year.  These award-winning films comprise the Full Frame Archive's collection.</p>

<p>In 2007, Duke University Libraries and Full Frame announced the creation of the Full Frame Archive, to be housed in Duke's David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, to acquire, archive and preserve copies of all of the Festival's award-winning films, with support from Eastman Kodak and Alpha Cine Labs, Seattle.

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The Full Frame Archive comprises preservation masters of documentary films that won awards at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival (formerly DoubleTake) between 1998 and 2010.  Formats include 35mm film, 16mm film, Digital Betacam cassette, HDCAM cassette, Betacam SP cassette, and DVD.  In addition, there is a complete set of festival program books.</p>

<p>The collection is organized chronologically, by festival year.  Each series in the collection includes all acquired award winners from one year, and each subseries comprises all the elements for one documentary work.    </p>

<p>Whenever possible, the film is preserved on 35mm film, a duplicate preservation master especially created for this collection; occasionally, the work was originally filmed on 35mm, but more often it was recorded digitally and then transferred to film for festival screenings and theatrical release.  Many films were never transferred to film, and in those cases, the highest quality digital master has been preserved, usually on Digital Betacam cassette, cloned from the master provided by the filmmaker or production company; other digital formats are represented as well.</p>

<p>While all are documentary films, some may also be considered belonging to the genres of biographical nonfiction, ethnographic, ethnic nonfiction and music.  Feature, short and animation forms are all represented.  The films vary widely in topic and style, with a predominant emphasis on human rights issues.  All of the films deal with social issues in one way or another, including topics such as gender; family relations; education; life cycles (childhood, aging, death, etc.); crime and justice; minority groups and discrimination; public health; humanitarian aid; technology and social life; migration; democracy; economic development; war and conflict; peace and healing; art and society; religion; rehabilitation; etc.   </p>

<p>Competition for awards has always been international; though the majority of award-winners are from and about the United States, the collection is also notably strong on topics relating to Africa and the Middle East. Only films completed within one year of the festival were eligible for competition, thus all are contemporary to the festival date.  The number and type of awards given at the Festival changed from year to year; thus, each year is represented by a different number of films, selected according to varying criteria.    </p>

<p>The Full Frame Archive was begun in late 2007 and acquisitions are ongoing.  The films are donated by the filmmaker and/or copyright holder.  Although the intent is to eventually preserve every Full Frame award winner, this may not be possible, as some copyright holders may decline to donate their work.  </p>

<p>These preservation masters are stored in a climate-controlled facility off-site and may not be viewed.  For viewing purposes, a DVD use copy has been provided in the reading room, backed up by a DVD master, also stored off-site.

		<p>A documentary about the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, nicknamed "The Farm," this film follows six inmates in a controlled and non-judgmental fashion, subtly revealing the inner-workings of an American way of life not often investigated.  The culmination of three years spent filming inside the penitentiary walls, <emph render="italic">The Farm</emph> speaks of the hopes and struggles of those who may never experience freedom again.</p>

		TRT: 80:00</p>
		<p>This film documents life in the Lodz Ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland, using a remarkable, recently discovered collection of color slides made by Walter Genewein, the Ghetto's chief Nazi accountant, who observed the people of the Ghetto with a cold, calculating eye. Genewein's pictures are juxtaposed with sorrowful and eloquently narrated memories of Arnold Mostowics, a Jewish medical doctor who survived the Lodz Ghetto and concentration camps. The film's riveting power comes from the tension between the two perspectives.</p>
<p>In German and Polish with English subtitles.</p>

		<p>During the Vietnam War era, the American people were split over their country's involvement overseas. But in 1973, thousands united to welcome home 462 American pilots held captive in North Vietnam for up to eight years. The first-person survival accounts of the pilots and the testimonies of their wives, who for so long did not know the status of their husbands, are woven together with Vietnamese archival footage to record a moving story of mental, physical and emotional resiliency.</p>

		<p>When James Allen opened the Addicts Rehabilitation Center in Harlem it was New York State's first residential treatment center for people without money. Forty-three years later, on some of America's meanest streets, the doors are still open. This film follows three addicts through A.R.C. as they try to break the grip of drugs. Can the battle against poverty, hopelessness and addiction ever be won?  Famed for its tough-love, trash-talking staff and its gospel choir, the Addicts Rehabilitation Center never gives up on people.</p>

		<p>Filmmaker Linda Duvoisin interviews five inspiring women about how they have overcome obstacles and maintained a passion for life.  Julie Brunzell, police officer; Ani DiFranco, musician, poet and entrepreneur; Linda Finney, police supervisor and poet; Myrtle Stedman, artist, writer and architect; and Jimmie Woodruff, retired housekeeper, share their wisdom in frank and provocative discourse on love, work, sex, prejudices, race, gender, violence, and creativity.  The five interviews are deftly interwoven to draw connections between the women's very different life experiences.</p>

		<p>This uplifting film tells the story of the Tony and Sally Amato and the opera company they created in 1948 and have nurtured for over 50 years.  They orchestrated every aspect of Amato Opera Company productions, in its tiny opera house in the Bowery: direction, training, costumes and even catering.  In the process, they provided rare opportunities and support for young singers.  Tony's almost manic energy, balanced by Sally's smiling calm and the powerful bond of love between them form the core of this tight-knit community-together, completely in love with opera.   </p>

		<p>Filmed over ten years in 16mm, this is a character portrait of Benjamin (1960-1999, no last name), presented in a fragmentary collage of still and moving images, interviews, and rehearsal and performance footage.   Lead singer/songwriter of the underground band Smoke, speed addict, sometime drag queen, rail-thin misfit, Benjamin speaks openly about his life, from his home in Cabbagetown, a poverty-stricken, marginal neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia. The film concludes with a musical eulogy from Patti Smith.</p>

		<p>Five young teachers in Los Angeles public schools are followed through their first year of teaching in some of the U.S.'s toughest elementary, middle and high schools.  Maurice Rabb, Nate Monley, Geneviève DeBose, Joy Kraft-Watts, and Georgene Acosta struggle to keep their students in school, fight city hall for funding, find special services, even teach without a classroom.  The First Year shows what happens when the system fails to serve, when families fail to support, and what the teachers must do when their idealism isn't enough, cutting through the rhetoric of the national debate about education to remind us of the powerful relationship between a teacher and a student.</p>

<p>In 1998 in Jasper, Texas, James Byrd, Jr., a black man, was chained to a pick-up truck and dragged to his death by three white men. The town was forever altered, and the nation woke up to the horror of a modern-day lynching. For this film, two film crews, one black and one white, set out to document the aftermath of the murder by following the subsequent trials of the local men charged with the crime. The result is an explicit and troubling portrait of race in America, asking how and why a crime like this could have occurred.</p>

		<p>The film follows an animated American peanut who sings about the difficulties faced by nuts from developing countries.  Mr. Peanut takes the viewer through the stories of the cashew, brazil and ground nuts in Mozambique, Bolivia, and Senegal, respectively-all of whom suffer as world trade is liberalized. But it is a different story in the U.S., where the peanut is protected by tariffs and heavily subsidized, and worth over four billion dollars a year to the American economy, making it the luckiest nut in the world.  </p>

		TRT: 86:00</p>
		<p>An in-depth look at urban gentrification, this film follows an African American, working-class neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, facing an influx of white, professional newcomers who are mostly gay and lesbian. Filmed over the course of four years, it considers all sides of the story, including a judge caught in the middle.  Tensions erupt over conflicting interests and values, exposing divisions along lines of race, sexual orientation, politics and especially class, as two historically oppressed groups bring out prejudice and insensitivity in each other.  </p>

		TRT: 153:00</p>
		<p>Filmed over ten years, this is the story of three generations of a family trying to break a cycle of drug abuse and child neglect, centered on the fraught relationship between Diane and her daughter Love.  A victim of the 1980s crack cocaine epidemic when Love was born, Diane lost custody of her six children for many years before reuniting them as teenagers.  Eighteen now and a mother herself, Love must reconcile her anger towards her mother, as she struggles to care for her baby Donyaeh and, after he is taken into foster care, regain custody of him.  Meanwhile, Diane strives to find her second chance, through therapy and job training programs, while trying to prevent her children from repeating her own mistakes.  Through the experiences of this family as they try to improve their situation, the film reveals how the Byzantine social welfare system that aims to help such families can also frustrate and limit them.  Ultimately, the emphasis is on a human journey towards love and forgiveness.</p>

<p>This intense film tells the story of the infamous Bus 174 Affair, when on June 14, 2000, a bus mugging in Rio de Janeiro turned into a frenzied hostage ordeal broadcast live on television.  Making dramatic use of footage shot that day, Padhila turns the tale into more than just an afternoon of horror, revealing the hostage-taker as a boy forced to live as a street kid after society systematically denied him any kind of social existence.</p>

<p>A tribute to the resiliency of childhood and the power of art, this film is a portrait of several children who live in Calcutta's red light district where their mothers work as prostitutes. Briski gives each child a camera and teaches them how to take pictures, nurturing their powers of observation, while trying to help them escape a grim future.  The children eagerly photograph the people and places in their neighborhoods, defying the tear-stained tourist snapshot of the global underbelly.</p>

		<p>A daughter regrets the words never spoken between her and her father, especially after a stroke limiting his ability to communicate.  Rodney Williams served in Vietnam, but was always evasive about his experiences, obscuring his stoic silence with playful humor.  But he kept a visual record in Vietnam, carrying both a still camera and an 8mm movie camera with him everywhere; his vivid images still speak to what his words cannot.</p>

		TRT: 98:00</p>
		<p>Morgan Spurlock challenges himself to eat three meals a day at McDonald's for thirty days, while limiting his physical activity to something near the national average.  He is medically monitored throughout.  At the outset, 32-year-old Spurlock is in excellent health; after a month, he has gained nearly 25 pounds, raised his cholesterol level to 230, and experienced mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and fat accumulation to his liver. His doctors were surprised at the rate of his deterioration.  Critical of fast-food advertising to children, the film provides a sometimes humorous look at American food culture and the obesity crisis.</p>

		<p>This biographical documentary on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., brings a fresh focus on his work in the last five years of his life.  Broadening his scope beyond race issues to fight poverty and oppose the Vietnam War, he alienated many of his closest associates.  This carefully researched film weaves together archival footage and interviews with his contemporaries to offer new insights into King's moral purpose and commitment to social justice.  </p>

		<p>An unflinching examination of what happens to those who die with no next of kin, this film follows the deaths of three such individuals in Los Angeles as their cases are processed by the coroner's office. Beginning with removal of the bodies, through burial and disposal of personal possessions, the steps are graphically depicted, gruesome and unsettling.  Civil servants go about these tasks professionally, thoroughly, and respectfully, as they weed through clues in the decedent's papers, assembling sad portraits of people left to die alone.   </p>

		<p>Rumidjah is a 62-year-old widow living in Jakarta, Indonesia, with her grown son Bakti and her 11-year-old granddaughter Tari-a Christian family in the largest Muslim country in the world.  The film portrays their everyday life, negotiating with money lenders and fighting a neighborhood fire in a bucket brigade. Rumidjah holds fast to her faith, but makes gracious concessions to the Muslim traditions of her neighbors; Bakti is independent and rebellious, but converts to Islam when he marries a Muslim woman. Creative and improbable camera shots illustrate and comment ironically and metaphorically on their situation.  This is the second in a trilogy of films about this family by Helmrich. </p>

		<p>Abu Dis is a small Palestinian village, divided in two by a wall built by the Israeli government.  The film follows the villagers' lives from before the wall, through the construction of first a temporary, then a final wall.  Moving in colliding microcosms, the inhabitants of the village and the Israeli soldiers protecting the border create an absurd routine of mutual respect and resentment. </p>

		<p>The right-to-die debate goes West in this riveting portrait of a man and his family grappling with a darker side of rugged individualism.  On Independence Day, Bob Stern finds out he is seriously ill-possibly dying. Bob decides to cheat that fate and take his own life. His family tries to stop him. But first, they set up a video camera. Part King Lear, part Western, the film offers an intimate exploration of nuclear family dynamics and a complex portrait of what is arguably a specifically American brand of hubris. </p>

		<p>This film takes us through three tumultuous years in the life of an idealistic high school student in Lubbock, Texas. We watch as she comes to question and resist the religious and political conservatism inculcated by her concerned, loving parents and overweening pastor, and fights for sex-education in her abstinence-only high school curriculum and the rights of a gay-straight alliance against complacent peers and the entrenched power of co-opting politicians.</p>

		<p>To mold the strategy for his 2002 campaign for the presidency of Bolivia, Gonzalo "Goni" Sánchez de Lozada hired an American consulting firm.  Stanley Greenburg, James Carville and Robert Shrum applied lessons from U.S. elections on branding and marketing to lead Goni to a narrow victory.  Fourteen months later, he was forced to resign during the 2003 Bolivian gas protests over privatization, in which 100 people died.  With remarkable access to backroom conversations, Boynton captures the campaign process as well as the key players' later reflections on the political effects and ethical implications of their work.</p>

		<p>Set against the dramatic backdrop of the Ashura holy days, this film explores the meaning of love among a cross section of Teheran's middle class.  Caught between ancient traditions and a 21st-century perspective informed by satellite TV and the Internet, they struggle to find romance amid the strict moral codes of their country.  Iranians young and old, married and single, speak candidly about love, marriage, and sex, revealing what it's like to seek and find love in modern Iran.</p>

		<p>Wetback follows undocumented migrant workers from their home in Nicaragua across Central America and Mexico to the U.S.-Mexican border, meeting many other migrants along the way.  They encounter gangs, vigilantes, corrupt law enforcement, physical danger, and safe havens in their attempt to be among the 10% of migrants who actually make it all the way into North America.  The migrants, those who aid them, and those who turn them back all give their own perspectives on how this vast, illegal system trafficking in cheap labor and dreams actually functions, and what its terrible costs and perils are.  </p>

		<p>During the 1990s and 2000s, a growing number of convicted felons were exonerated by DNA evidence as its use increased-more than 150 by 2005.  But establishing their innocence is only the beginning of the story.  Once released, they face the challenges of returning to their families and too society-often with their criminal records left intact and no apology for their false imprisonment.  This film follows seven such exonerees through their difficult transitions to life on the outside, as they pursue new goals and transform themselves.   </p>

		<p>An poetic opus in three parts, this film presents three distinct stories, regions and cinematic styles: A child is apprenticed to the domineering owner of a Baghdad garage; Sadr followers in two Shiite cities rally for regional elections while violently enforcing Islamic law; a family of Kurdish farmers welcomes the U.S. presence, which brings them a measure of new freedom. Longley spent more than two years filming in Iraq before it became too dangerous for Western filmmakers to be there.  </p>

		<p>Accused of raping and murdering a young white newspaper reporter in 1984, Hunt was at age 19 convicted by an all-white jury, despite the fact that no physical evidence linked him to the crime. Sentenced to life in prison, Hunt was finally cleared of the crime in 1994 when DNA testing proved his innocence, yet was not released until 2004. In a country that boasts a system of blind justice for all, Darryl Hunt's story speaks to the fear and racism that continue to define communities throughout the nation.</p>

		<p>This film looks at the 2004 Election Day failures in one of Cleveland, Ohio's poorest neighborhoods. In the most hotly contested state in the country, gridlock at inner city polls ignites tempers and sets off charges of conspiracy-Paglin drops us squarely into the chaos, observing the irascible octogenarian councilwoman Ms. Fannie Lewis as she takes on polling place breakdowns, an unresponsive bureaucracy and an increasingly agitated electorate.</p>

		<p>Sierra Leone's civil war (1991-2002) displaced hundreds of thousands of people, mostly to refugee camps in Guinea. Seeking to rebuild relationships and express the emotions engendered by the war and devastation, Reuben Koroma, Francis Franco Langba, Efuah Grace, Mohammed Bangura, Arahim Kamara and Alhadji Black Nature Kamara formed an Afro-pop band, the Refugee All-Stars. Their songs bring solace to their countrymen and help the musicians to survive in the post-civil war landscape of their homeland. Compelling personal stories and the infectious music itself suffuse this look at a band of survivors determined to use music to establish a new community.</p>

		<p>A bittersweet time capsule of alienation, discovery, racism and belonging, this is a chronicle of immigration in Britain, as seen through the eyes of one Asian family and their movie camera.  In 1965, Yash Pal Suri left India to pursue his medical studies in England.  He immediately bought two sets of home movie equipment; one he sent to his family in India, and the other he kept for himself.  For forty years, this extended family exchanged "cine-letters," chronicling their daily lives.</p>

		TRT: 83:29</p>
		<p>This film tells the long suppressed story of the GI movement to end the war in Vietnam.  Contrary to the popular image of long-haired hippies spitting on returning soldiers, this account vividly demonstrates that GIs, for whom it was a life-and-death issue, were at the heart of the anti-war movement.  Narrated by veteran GI resisters recalling peace marches and stiff jail sentences, it deals with racial politics, class and personal responsibility, challenging us to re-examine our received history of the Vietnam War. </p>

		<p>Has manual labor disappeared in the twenty-first century, or has it just become invisible?  This film presents five portraits of extreme physical labor under dangerous conditions around the world: illegal coal mining in the Ukraine's Donbass Basin; sulfur mining on Kawah Ijen, Indonesia; livestock slaughtering in Port Harcourt, Nigeria; shipbreaking in Gaddani Pakistan, and steel smelting in Liaoning, China.  In-depth interviews with the workers reveal both the hardships and injustices they experience, as well as the pride they find in their work.  An epilogue visits a former steelworks in Germany, now a theme park and site for public art.  The film is scored by John Zorn. Contains graphic images related to animal slaughter.</p>

		<p>Poitras follows Iraqi physician Dr. Riyadh, father of six and Sunni political candidate, through the eight months leading up to Iraq's first elections after the fall of Sadaam Hussein.  An outspoken critic of the occupation, Dr. Riyadh is passionate about building democracy in his country.

		<p>Cell phone conversations have the ability to collapse the distinctions between public and private space. In these conversations, intimate moments are performed for strangers in public spaces and director Eva Weber captures these moments, recording cell phone conversations in the public sphere. The film weaves these seemingly unrelated conversations into a cohesive documentary narrative.  </p>

		<p>This film follows two Bantu families, displaced by the Somalian civil war, as they journey from a refugee camp in Kenya to the U.S. They struggle with the seemingly impossible tasks of daily life in America-supporting a family, learning English, and applying rural skills to an unfamiliar urban lifestyle. Both families seek a balance between a way of life they know and trust and their new place in America, reconciling their dreams of the land of freedom with the puzzling and difficult reality.</p>

		<p>A group of Acholi children in Northern Uganda's Patongo refugee camp prepares a music and dance performance to compete in Uganda's annual National Kampala Music Festival.  Northern Uganda has been at war for over twenty years with the rebel group Lord's Resistance Army, which abducts children as young as five to join their ranks. Several children share accounts of devastated lives, assaulted bodies, and lost family members. This compassionate film reveals the hope, peace and even joy the children find in music and dance, soothing the wounds of war. </p>

		<p>Waichi Okumura was an "ant soldier" in the Japanese military, one who performed the lowest and dirtiest jobs in World War II.  After Japan's surrender, he and 2600 other soldiers were ordered to stay behind to fight in China's civil war, not returning home until 1954. Now 80, he insists on clearing the record with the Japanese government, which claims that these soldiers volunteered to stay behind. Okumura returns to the killing fields in Shanxi Province and meets some of his former enemies. This film portrays the moral conviction of a man abandoned by his country after he had been taught to kill for it.</p>

		<p>Bothshabelo is a village, a school, and an orphanage, providing sanctuary to hundreds of South Africans marginalized by race, class, sexual assault and the effects of the prevailing AIDS epidemic.  This film tells the story of Marion Cloete, who traded in a cushy upper class lifestyle in Johannesburg to found it, and the people she cares for.  A visual intervention in a nation overwhelmed by rape, violence, HIV/AIDS, and the legacy of Apartheid, this film offers a pathway of hope.</p>

		<p>An up-close and uncompromising look at the crisis in Darfur, this film exposes the ongoing tragedy in Sudan as seen through the eyes of one American witness, former U.S. Marine Captain Brian Steidle, an official military observer.  Armed with just a camera, paper and pen, but with access far beyond that of a journalist, Steidle's photographs and testimony reveal a genocide that had by 2007 claimed over 400,000 lives.  The film presents the historical and economic basis for the Sudanese government's support and encouragement of the atrocities, alongside UN and US debates on the definition of "genocide," as millions of people suffer.</p>

		<p>For two decades, the Acholi people of Northern Uganda have been caught in a civil war between a rebel group whose main objective is inhumane terror and a government whose military response has often increased suffering. Over 1.5 million people have been displaced into camps and over 25,000 children have been abducted as soldiers and sex slaves.  Against this backdrop, children who have never known peace live as if they still believe in the future. The embodiment of resilience and hope, this film tells their story, and that of Uganda's fight to be free.</p>

		<p>Cimetière du Père-Lachaise, one of Paris's largest cemeteries, is the final resting place of many great artists, writers and composers of the nineteenth and twentieth century.  Heddy Honigmann observes the visitors that come each day to pay their respects and asks them why they have come; some, she follows into their own creative lives in the city.  A Japanese pianist rehearses Chopin and seeks inspiration from his grave; an Iranian singer finds resonance in the novels of his compatriot Sadegh Hedayat; an embalmer admires Modigliani's gift for portraiture; and a succession of avid readers pay homage to Marcel Proust.  Others come to mourn their loved ones, or simply to meditate on mortality.  The film is a pensive reflection on the power of art to move and inspire us "forever."</p>

		<p>Banished examines the legacy of racial cleansing incidents that occurred in communities scattered throughout the United States in the early twentieth century, when violent mobs forced thousands of African-American families to abandon their homes.  Three communities are profiled, each approaching the challenge of reconciliation differently. In Forsyth County, Georgia, an African-American family seeks compensation for their lost land, legally transferred to white ownership by "adverse possession; a reconciliation committee stalemates.  Descendants of a family banished from Pierce City, Missouri, retrieve their great-grandfather's remains and ask the city to cover the cost. Harrison, Arkansas, is divided between those who would make amends for their town's racist past and those who are drawn to its lack of black people.  The film raises broader questions about how past wrongs can or cannot be redressed, by whom, and through what acts.</p>

		<p>This film illuminates the mercurial nature of biblical interpretations and the diverse philosophies of homosexuality they engender, illustrating the heated battles over homosexuality within Christian America through personal stories.  Five Christian families who have come to terms with a gay or lesbian child are profiled; they discuss honestly how they coped with the tensions between religious beliefs, cultural expectations, and their love for their families.  The solutions they find are as varied as the families themselves.  The families of Congressman Richard Gephardt and Bishop Gene Robinson are among those profiled.  Their stories are contextualized within the broader theological debate, including contributions from Anita Bryant, Rev. Jimmy Creech, Dr. James Dobson, Rev. Peter Gomes, Rabbi Steve Greenberg, Dr. Laurence C. Keene, Andrew Sullivan, and Bishop Desmond Tutu.  Ultimately, the film offers pathways to family healing and understanding in the face of hatred.</p>

		<p>On August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit, a young French wire walker and street performer, stepped out onto a wire illegally rigged between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center.  He spent nearly an hour walking, dancing, kneeling, and lying on the wire 1,350 feet above the streets of Manhattan before being arrested.   After six years of dreaming and planning, Petit and a team of friends smuggled cables and equipment past security and rig them to withstand wind and swaying, all without being detected.  Evoking a heist film, Man on Wire uses rare historic footage and stills along with re-enactments and present-day interviews with co-conspirators to tell the story of "the artistic crime of the century."</p>

		<p>A street-level account of Hurricane Katrina (2005), the film opens the day before the storm with footage by aspiring rap artist Kimberly Rivers Roberts of her Ninth Ward neighborhood. With no way to leave the city, she and her husband Scott tape their harrowing ordeal as the floodwaters rise. This 15 minutes of home movie footage is interwoven with archival news segments and verité footage shot over the next two years, telling a story of remarkable people surviving not only failed levees, bungling bureaucrats and armed soldiers, but also their own past.</p>

		<p><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Lioness </title>tells the story of five female Army soldiers who were among the first women in U.S. history to be sent into direct ground combat.  Without the same training as their male counterparts but committed to serve as needed, they fought in some of the bloodiest battles of the second Iraq war, becoming part of the first generation of female combat veterans. Told through intimate accounts, journal excerpts, archival footage, and interviews with military commanders, the film forms a portrait of the emotional and psychological effects of war from a female point of view.</p>

		<p>Over the past four decades, Isaiah Zagar has covered more than 50,000 square feet of Philadelphia with stunning mosaic murals. His son Jeremiah chronicles his father's work and tumultuous relationship with his wife, Julia, following them as their marriage implodes.  The film is a beautiful and unsettling look into what it can mean to be an artist, walking the edge of sanity, and to be part of an artist's family. </p>

		<p>Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Wangari Maathai transformed the simple act of planting trees into Kenya's Green Belt Movement, a nationwide political movement to safeguard the environment, protect human rights, and defend democracy, as Kenya recovered, politically, culturally and environmentally from colonial exploitation. In the past thirty years, this charismatic woman has emerged as an icon of pro-democracy activism and feminism.</p>

		<p>For 15 years, Carroll Pickett, minister to death row inmates at a penitentiary in Texas, had no reservations about presiding over executions, until his path crossed that of Carlos de Luna, unjustly accused of homicide. Pickett became unshakably convinced of the man's innocence, and teamed up with crime reporters from the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Chicago Tribune</title> to delve into the facts surrounding De Luna's arraignment. This documentary uses Pickett's story as a springboard into broader issues about capital punishment.</p>

		<p>Over the summer vacation, a Finnish couple opens their home to a Russian orphan who lives in an orphanage just over the border; the distance between them turns out to be much greater.  Eleven-year-old Sveta speaks no Finnish and struggles to express herself; the well-meaning Finns, Tiina and Peter, attempt to communicate through bedtime stories and shopping sprees.  But are good intentions enough to acclimatize Sveta to the west and bridge the gap?  Can an act of charity become a real connection?  </p>

		<p>Filmed over the course of 23 years, this film is a collaboration of cinematographer Ellen Kuras with the film's subject Thavisouk Phrasavath.  Victims of the U.S.'s secret war in Laos, Thavisouk's family escaped to a refugee camp and then to America, deposited in a crowded tenement in Brooklyn.  The family struggles to survive and stay together, terrorized by local gangs and haunted by memories.  A melding of memoir, cinema verité and historical inquiry, <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Betrayal</title> is the tale of a country and a family torn asunder, and of the long, painful process of repair.</p>

		<p>At the Bangor International Airport in Maine, often the last stop for American troops leaving for war in Iraq and Afghanistan and the first when they return, three senior citizens faithfully greet returning troops or share a moment with departing soldiers. Bill Knight, Joan Gaudet, and Jerry Mundy have spent the last five years welcoming and thanking over 700,000 soldiers. More than a welcome distraction from their own health problems and personal losses, these encounters are a source of strength and inspiration as they face the challenges of growing old. </p>

		<p>This film tells the story of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), non-profit media organization, and its role in the battle for a free and democratic Myanmar (formerly called Burma).  When Buddhist monks began to march against Myanmar's oppressive regime in September 2007, the DVB's brave journalists used small digital camcorders to document the burgeoning demonstrations and subsequent violent repression.  The video footage was out of the country for worldwide distribution.  Startling on-the-scene footage is combined with evocative reconstructions from the point of view of "Joshua," an exiled member of the DVB team.</p>

His devoted disciple, Tenzin Zopa sets off on this on this quest through breathtaking landscapes and remote traditional Tibetan villages. Along the way, Tenzin listens to stories about young children with special characteristics and performs rarely seen ritualistic tests to determine the likelihood of reincarnation. He eventually presents the child he believes to be his reincarnated master to the Dalai Lama so that he can make the final decision.</p>

He must choose between damaging his vocal cords trying to hit the high notes or dashing his hopes by walking away.  This is a tender portrayal of a universal, yet intensely personal, rite of passage.</p>

		<p>El-Sayed, a Bedouin village in the Negev Desert, is home to the largest community of deaf people in the world, where deafness is seen as a natural part of life.  The hearing and the deaf coexist easily in this remote society, but when one father, Salim, decides to get a cochlear implant for his toddler son Muhammad, members of the tight-knit community have distinct, strong opinions.  For Muhammad, the road to hearing is long, painful, and garbled.  With creative sound editing, Leshem shows how the gift of hearing may feel like a loss of community and identity.  </p>

		<p>This wordless film depicts the scale and beauty of the Baltic Sea.  At first, no human presence disturbs the sound, color and force of the Baltic, revealed in a sequence of large, rhythmic shots. Suddenly, all is disrupted by an enormous oil tanker plying the Gulf of Finland.  The immense scale of the oil industry mirrors the grandeur of the sea, as humans, technology, and nature converge in unexpected ways in this quiet, lyrical film. </p>

Highlighted stories include those of: Ward Churchill, a professor fired from the University of Colorado after 9/11; Debbie Almontaser, the principal of a public school in New York caught up in irrational anti-Muslim frenzy; Tyler Chase Harper, the Poway, California, high school student suspended for wearing a handmade anti-gay T-shirt; and the surveillance of protesters at the 2004 Republican Convention.  A wide variety of experts and participants, from across the political spectrum, contribute their thoughts and experiences to this filmic essay. </p>

		<p>There are now over five hundred Thai women in Thy, a small Danish fishing community, married to Danish men.  Fifteen years ago, there was only Sommai, who has since become a professional matchmaker, bringing family and others over from Thailand to marry Danish men.  The film profiles several of the women and follows a new arrival as she the well-worn path from Bangkok to Copenhagen to find a suitable husband in three months before her visa expires, awkwardly courted by a respectable young Dane.  Through intimate interviews and beautiful cinematography, director Janus Metz captures a meditation on loneliness and love. </p>

<p>Artist Vik Muniz, known for painting with nontraditional materials, returned to his native Brazil to portray workers in one of the world's largest garbage dumps, Jardim Gramacho, on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro.  He collaborated with these <emph render="italic">"catadores"</emph>-self-designated scavengers of recyclable materials-to create portraits of them made entirely of garbage, returning the profits from their sale to his subjects. Over three years, the filmmakers followed Muniz and this eclectic band of catadores, revealing both the dignity and despair of their lives, in a multivalent collaborative work engaging with issues of artistic process, social justice, responsibility to one's subjects, class mobility, activism, and beauty.   </p>

		<p>This film is the culmination of ten years of obsessive research by Cambodian investigative reporter Thet Sambath on the reasons for the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge genocide in which almost two million people, including Thet's parents and brother, were brutally tortured and executed in the killing fields of Cambodia.  Thet conducted interviews throughout the countryside, gaining the trust of men who actually carried out the killings.  Courageously, they tell the truth and, literally, show where the bodies are buried.  But they do not understand why they were ordered to kill.  Thet's major achievement is to cultivate the confidence of Pol Pot's second-in-command, Nuon Chea (a.k.a. Brother Number Two); after thirty years of silence, Nuon admits to Thet on camera in detail how they decided to kill party members whom they considered "enemies of the people."  A cru+-cial piece in Cambodia's national process of reconciliation, these testimonies trace the transformation of abstract political principles into mass murder.</p>

<p>What happens when the world you were raised to believe in disappears?  Through interviews and expertly edited archival footage and home movies, Hessman explores the experiences of ordinary Russians raised and educated under the Soviet system, who came of age in under glasnost and perestroika.  She follows the stories of five Moscow classmates, who reflect honestly on their childhoods and how they reconcile them with their adult lives: history teachers Borya and Lyuba, a married couple; Olga, a single mother who works for a billiard table company; Ruslan, once a popular punk rocker, now a busker in the Moscow metro; and Andrei, a successful businessman who owns a chain of stores selling expensive French shirts.</p>

<p>A wartime love story provides a fresh perspective on life under Germany's Third Reich.  As a confident, bubbly teenager, Jutta is surprised to learn that she is half-Jewish, launching her resistance to the Nazis.  She falls in love with Helmuth, an injured German soldier.  Disillusioned, Helmuth joins the unsuccessful Valkyrie plot to assassinate Hitler.  Jutta, Helmuth, and her parents are relentlessly pursued by the Nazi machine and separately imprisoned.  Incredibly, all four survive and are reunited at the end of the war.  Jutta eloquently narrates her own story, illustrated with original 8mm footage (shot by Helmuth) and rare archival footage.</p>

<p>Miri, a Korean adoptee who grew up and lives in Sweden is a self-described loner. She comes home from her job as a librarian every evening and invents funky, creative outfits for her fashion blog-her main outlet for personal expression and social interaction.  In words and artistic photography, she shares her life with her readers, from mundane details to musings on the psychological consequences of international adoption.  With no narration and little spoken dialogue, the film is a visually poetic portrait of Miri.</p>

<p>An intersection in Fort Pierce, Florida, provides a microcosm of one of America's most controversial ideological wars.  An abortion clinic named A Woman's World sits across the street from the pro-life Pregnancy Care Center.  Pregnant teenagers and women often mistake the pro-life center for the abortion clinic, and are patiently and persuasively counseled by its staff, often with deceptive tactics, to keep their pregnancies.  Meanwhile, the medical staff of the clinic try to counsel patience to make their own choices and to perform their work under siege; pro-life protesters walk the sidewalk in front of the clinic day and night, hectoring patients, and the physician must arrive and leave from work anonymously, concealed under a sheet, to protect his own life.  Turning a non-judgmental lens on both camps, Grady and Ewing use the extraordinary access they gained to practitioners, protestors, and patients to show us a conflict with seemingly no possible resolution.</p>

		<p>This portrait of horse trainer Buck Brannaman takes the animal-human relationship as a metaphor for facing the challenges of life. Buck was a professional rope trick performer by the age of six, exploited and violently abused by his father. Today, he is known for his compassionate approach to working with horses, eschewing violence and punishment in favor of a respect for the way horses think (he is one of the inspirations for the novel and film <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Horse Whisperer</title>).  The film follows Buck  on the road; he travels nine months out of the year teaching clinics where he "helps horses with people problems," coaching riders and starting (rather than "breaking") young horses.  </p>

<p>Once a thriving coal-mining area, the Donetsk region of the Ukraine is now peppered with makeshift illegal mines, excavated in demolished buildings, parks and backyards. Economic hardship has driven even children to work in the mines. Marianna Kaat follows the trials of fifteen-year old Yura and his two sisters. Living apart from their alcoholic parents, they rely on Yura to mine for eight to twelve hours a day to support them. He cannot consistently attend school, though he dreams of someday earning certification as a baker to run a café. Ironically, his grandfather was a powerful Soviet coal plant director. The film follows the children for over a year as they struggle to pay their bills and stay together. </p>

<p>This is the story of the revival of the language of the Wampanoag people of New England. All speakers of the language had died out when in 1994 Jessie Little Doe, a Wampanoag social worker began to wonder if it could be recovered.  With M.I.T. linguist Ken Hale, with whom she earned a Master's degree, she and other linguists pieced the language together from old documents and related Native American languages. Through community-wide efforts among the Aquinnah and Mashpee Wampanoag, the language is being spoken again, and Jessie's young daughter is the first native speaker of Wampanoag in more than a hundred years. </p>

<p>St. Luke's and St. Andrew's Parish Church in Glasgow's East End, with a congregation of only 26, is slated for closure by the Church of Scotland; the new minister bitterly preaches that it should be left to die. This verité film captures with a light touch the activities of the still-vibrant community within the church's walls, from line dancing to yoga to lunch, anchored by the labors of Tommy Healy, the building's caretaker.  </p>
