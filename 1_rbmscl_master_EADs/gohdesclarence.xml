         <p>Clarence Louis Frank Gohdes began his
		  post-undergraduate studies at Harvard, where he turned his
		  attention from Latin to American literature under the
		  tutelage of Bliss Perry, J. L. Lowes, G. L. Kittredge, and
		  Kenneth B. Murdock. At Columbia, Gohdes wrote his
		  dissertation under Ralph L. Rusk. </p>
         <p>Gohdes earned his scholarly reputation through his
		  work in American literature. He published two texts, one on
		  Ralph Waldo Emerson and the other on Walt Whitman, that
		  contributed to American literary scholarship through his
		  original research and archival work. Gohdes also influenced
		  the formation of American literary studies through his
		  long-standing position as Managing Editor (under Jay B.
		  Hubbell, founding editor) and then Editor-in-Chief of
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">American Literature</title>,
		the discipline's foundational academic journal. Similarly,
		Gohdes's
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">A Bibliographical Guide to the
		  Study of the Literature of the U.S.A.</title>, which went
		through five editions, played a key role in documenting and
		making accessible American literary criticism. Gohdes's
		career achievements attest to his role in extending the
		work of scholars of American literature.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Clarence Louis Frank Gohdes Papers date from
		  1811 to the 1990s, with the bulk of the collection dating
		  from 1905 to 1981. The collection consists of research
		  materials, correspondence, writings, clippings and other
		  printed materials, and a few photographs, mainly from the
		  latter half of Gohdes's career. The earliest date (1811)
		  refers to reproductions of original materials used in his
		  research. Correspondence with other American Literature
		  teachers and authors, combined with other materials
		  relating to Gohdes's institutional and organizational
		  affiliations, in particular with
		  <corpname>Duke University, </corpname>the
		  <corpname>Modern Language Association</corpname>
		  (MLA), and
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">American Literature</title>,
		comprise the most substantive aspects of this collection.
		They provide insight into the bureaucratic and
		institutional exigencies of
		<subject>American literary scholarship</subject> in
		the mid-twentieth century. Major authors and scholars of
		the time wrote to Gohdes, and include
		<persname>Alexander Blackburn</persname>,
		<persname>Oscar Cargill</persname>,
		<persname>Lewis Chase</persname>,
		<persname>Robert Elias</persname>,
		<persname>Norman Foerster</persname>,
		<persname>Arthur Rubin, </persname>
            <persname>Arthur Quinn, </persname>and
		<persname>Upton Sinclair</persname>. Original
		manuscripts by Gohdes, inscribed reprints of writings by
		his colleagues, and materials relating to many major
		British and American literary figures, make up the rest of
		the collection. There is substantial material on
		<persname>Edgar Allen Poe</persname>. The collection
		also includes papers documenting his research and writing
		for his last book project, a cultural and horticultural
		history of the scuppernong grape entitled
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">Scuppernong, North Carolina's
		  Grape and Its Wines</title>. The Gohdes Papers are divided
		into seven series: <emph render="bold">Biographical
		Data</emph>, <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Author Files</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches</emph>,
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">
               <emph render="bold">Scuppernong</emph>
            </title>, and
		<emph render="bold">Clippings</emph>.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Biographical Data
		  Series</emph> briefly sketches the major events of Gohdes's
		  life. It consists of only a few items, including a one-page
		  sketch by Gohdes of his career's highlights, and
		  photocopies of Gohdes's obituaries. Further biographical
		  information, especially pertaining to Gohdes's academic
		  life, can be culled from materials in the
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>.</p>
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
		  Series</emph> contains letters exchanged with university
		  administrators, publishers, colleagues, librarians, and
		  literary figures. The series is divided into four
		  subseries,
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">
               <emph render="bold">American
		  Literature</emph>
            </title>, <emph render="bold">Lewis
		Chase</emph>, <emph render="bold">Duke University</emph>,
		and <emph render="bold">General</emph>. The bulk of the
		correspondence concerns professional and academic affairs,
		such as appointments, editorships, research and reviews,
		and publishing. Included are exchanges between Gohdes and
		Duke University administrators about English Department and

		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">American Literature</title>
		affairs, as well as between Gohdes and contemporary
		literary critics about the study of American literature.
		There are also several documents that illuminate Gohdes's
		political affiliations and social concerns.</p>
         <p>Materials on approximately fifty authors, largely
		  major British and American writers, are in the
		  <emph render="bold">Author Files Series</emph> and were
		  originally gathered by Gohdes and his colleague, Lewis
		  Chase. The folders contain a variety of information on the
		  represented authors, in an equally varied mix of formats:
		  clippings, notes, lectures, student papers, photographs,
		  and reproductions or photocopies of original writing.</p>
         <p>Included in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files
		  Series </emph>are materials relating to several projects
		  and interests which engaged Gohdes during his career. These
		  include:
		  <genreform>bibliographies, </genreform>
            <genreform>poetry, </genreform>
            <genreform>travel narratives </genreform>and the
		  <geogname>American West, </geogname>and the United
		  Nations' Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
		  (UNESCO)/American Literature Section's Best American Books
		  List. The bibliographies collected in this series reflect
		  Gohdes's interest in this genre, as he participated in and
		  edited many such projects throughout his career. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches
		  Series</emph> contains manuscript and printed materials in
		  two subseries: <emph render="bold">Writings by
		  Gohdes</emph> and <emph render="bold">Writings by
		  Others</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Writings by Gohdes
		  Subseries</emph> includes manuscripts of short stories,
		  poetry, and academic essays, as well as notes and
		  notecards. The manuscripts also contain folders pertaining
		  to unfinished projects and writings. The
		  <emph render="bold">Writings by Gohdes Subseries</emph>
		  also contains several folders of printed materials,
		  consisting of reprints and reproductions of as well as
		  advertising and promotional materials for Gohdes's
		  published writings. This subseries consists almost entirely
		  of reprints that are inscribed to Gohdes by the

		  Gohdes's last published book,
		<title render="italic" linktype="simple">Scuppernong, North Carolina's
		  Grape and Its Wines</title>, are in the <emph render="bold">
               <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Scuppernong</title>
		Series</emph>. Three subseries make up this series:
		<emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>,
		<emph render="bold">Research and Notes</emph>, and
		<emph render="bold">Publication Materials</emph>.
		Correspondence plus photocopied articles and essays about
		the grape and agricultural production form the bulk of the

               <p>Chiefly concerns professional and academic
				interests. The series is divided into four sections:
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">American
				Literature</title>,
			 <persname>Lewis Chase</persname>,
			 <corpname>Duke University</corpname>, and
			 General. </p>
               <p>The
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">American
				Literature</title> correspondence mainly addresses
			 administrative issues and editorial appointments. In
			 particular, the letters represent discussions among Gohdes,
			 Duke administrators, the
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">American
				Literature</title> editorial board, and representatives of
			 the American Literature Section (ALS) of the Modern
			 Language Association over a 1966-1968 reworking of the
			 contractual agreement between Duke and the ALS.</p>
               <p>The Lewis Chase correspondence contains
				letters exchanged between him and libraries and colleagues.
				All letters concern Chase's research on Edgar Allen
				Poe.</p>
               <p>Duke University Correspondence contains
				letters about Gohdes's discussions with the University and
				its English department over hiring, tenure, and his
				professorship. Included is a series of letters between
				<persname>Arlin Turner</persname>, Gohdes, and
				the administration that concerns a disagreement over the
				editorship of
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">American
				Literature</title>. The group also contains one letter from

			 <persname>Lyne S. Few</persname>, son of William
			 Preston Few, that recounts his memories of Duke faculty and
			 his father's role at Duke. It was written in response to
			 reading Gohdes's booklet,
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Pioneers in English at
				Trinity and Duke</title>.</p>
               <p>The General Correspondence includes letters
				from colleagues and peers, contemporary authors, and
				publishers and librarians. The main topics of discussion
				are professional, such as job appointments and
				recommendations, research and reviews, and publishing. The
				files include letters exchanged with some of the major
				scholars and authors of the day:
				<persname>Alexander Blackburn</persname>,
				<persname>Walter Blair</persname>,
				<persname>Van Wyck Brooks</persname>,
				<persname>Oscar Cargill</persname>,
				<persname>Robert Elias</persname>,
				<persname>Norman Foerster</persname>,
				<persname>Ima Honaker Herron</persname>,
				<persname>James Meriwether</persname>,
				<persname>Perry Miller</persname>,
				<persname>William Mulder</persname>,
				<persname>Arthur Quinn</persname>,
				<persname>Louis Rubin</persname>,
				<persname>Arthur M. Schlesinger</persname>
				(single item),
				<persname>Upton Sinclair</persname>,
				<persname>Henry Nash Smith</persname>,
				<persname>Robert Spiller</persname>,
				<persname>George R. Stewart</persname>, and
				<persname>George F. Whicher</persname>.
				Substantial correspondence exists between Gohdes and
				<persname>Thomas O. Mabbott</persname>,
				<persname>Henry A. Pochmann</persname>, and
				<persname>James Woodress</persname>. Other
				items of interest include a letter from
				<persname>Martha Baird</persname> (Mrs. Eli
				Siegel) to Gohdes which includes a copy of a letter from
				<persname>William Carlos Williams</persname>,
				letters exchanged with
				<persname>Clayton L. Eichelberger</persname>
				concerning the establishment of
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">American Literary
				Realism</title> (journal), and invitations to Richard
			 Nixon's 1971 and Ronald Reagan's 1985 inaugurations. Gohdes
			 saved several form letters from major intellectual and
			 political leaders: Albert Einstein; Archibald MacLeish;
			 Richard M. Nixon; Pearl S. Buck; Jacques Cousteau; and
			 Nancy Reagan (letter contains autograph). Arranged
			 chronologically by date within each section.</p>

               <p>Consists of clippings, student papers, and
				notes. Some author files contain only printed materials or
				other non-original materials. Some, however, contain
				original notes, lectures, or early twentieth-century
				student papers. Lectures, usually by Lewis Chase, provide
				insight into turn-of-the-century literary perspectives on
				major authors from Poe to Shakespeare. The student papers
				suggest the scope and range of literary training and
				pedagogy at this moment in history.</p>
               <p>This series contains a large amount of
				material belonging to Dr. Lewis Chase (1873-1937). It seems
				that many unattributed items and folders came from Chase,
				including all student papers. The files which contain
				material compiled or created by Gohdes include those on
				Anderson, Dickinson, Dreiser, Eliot, Emerson, Faulkner,
				Fitzgerald, Frost, Garland, Holmes, Howells, James, Lanier,
				Longfellow, O'Neill, Ransom, Twain, and Updike. In
				particular, the Emerson "Notes" and Longfellow folders
				include substantial original materials by Gohdes. The rest
				of the folders seem to be heavily weighted to Chase
				materials, with only some of Gohdes's resources added. Most
				of the British authors are from Chase, whereas Gohdes is
				responsible for the American author materials.</p>
               <p>Several of the author files contain
				photocopies of selections or excerpts from the author's
				writing, for example, most of the Twain and all of the
				Sidgwick folders. "Mark Twain's Funniest" folders seem to
				have been one of Gohdes's projects.</p>
               <p>Within each folder, arranged alphabetically by
				author, items are arranged chronologically. Author names
				have been standardized on folder titles.</p>

               <p>Organized into groupings reflecting Gohdes's
				interests and projects: bibliographies, poetry, travel
				narratives of the American West, and UNESCO's best books
				list.</p>
               <p>The bibliographic materials contain issues of
				the
			 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bulletin of
				Bibliography</title> and bibliographic information that
			 Gohdes requested, such as library holdings in literature in
			 various areas, including Cleveland, St. Louis, and Balboa
			 Heights (Canal Zone).</p>
               <p>The poetry files contain copies and
				mimeographs of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
				poetry. "Contemporary Poetry," "Modern Poetry" and "Poetry"
				all contain early twentieth century materials. The first
				folder, "Criticism and Reviews," contains reprints of
				essays and articles by various authors. The only original
				writing can be found in the second folder, "Introductory
				Lecture, University of Wisconsin," which Lewis Chase may
				have written. </p>
               <p>The "Travel Narratives and the West" folders
				contain photocopies and reproductions of nineteenth-century
				accounts of travel through the western United States, with
				some notes by Gohdes.</p>
               <p>Inspired by the UNESCO translation project,
				Gohdes initiated a survey of leading American literature
				critics and scholars in 1949 to determine the best twenty
				American books. Gohdes and his fellow committee members,
				<persname>Jay B. Hubbell</persname> and
				<persname>Lewis Leary</persname>, successfully
				polled approximately twenty-five people. Those polled
				include many major critics of the day:
				<persname>Ralph Rusk</persname>,
				<persname>Walter Blair</persname>,
				<persname>Henry Canby</persname>,
				<persname>Mark Van Doren</persname>,
				<persname>Fred Lewis Pattee</persname>,
				<persname>F. O. Matthiessen</persname>,
				<persname>Van Wyck Brooks</persname>,
				<persname>Clarence Gohdes</persname>,
				<persname>Jay B. Hubbell</persname>,
				<persname>Charles Anderson</persname>, and
				<persname>Henry Nash Smith</persname>. Files
				includes correspondence from these critics discussing and
				listing their choices for the best twenty American books.
				The survey seems to have been passed on to UNESCO, and was
				used for publicity for the American Literature Section of
				the Modern Language Association by submitting the final
				tallied poll to newspapers and journals. Arranged
				alphabetically.</p>

				  several academic pieces (other academic writing, such as

				  The manuscripts include work Gohdes did on an anthology,
				  "True Stories about Indians from
				<title render="italic" linktype="simple">St. Nicholas
				  Magazine</title> and
				<title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Youth's

                  <p>Notes and notecards pertain to Gohdes's more
				  formal projects, while others provide insight into his many
				  different interests. For example, a datebook contains "Some
				  notes on big trees," which concern early literary
				  references to large trees in the United States. Included is
				  a notebook containing Gohdes's research on
				  <subject>American humor</subject>. There are
				  notes for a proposed project, "A Series on American
				  Argument for Peace," containing very rough bibliographic
				  notes on possible entries.</p>
                  <p>The Printed Materials consist of reprints of

				<title render="italic" linktype="simple">Scuppernong</title>. The

				<persname>Secondo Guasti</persname>, a
				Californian wine-grower, and on
				<corpname>Garrett and Company</corpname>, an
				American winery. The "Printed Materials" folders consist
				mainly of brochures and pamphlets relating to the
				agriculture and science of grape production in the American
				South, many of which were published by government- or
				university-sponsored organizations. Also part of the
				subseries are several folders of notes, mainly on index
				cards, as well as folders on the two Garrett brothers
				(owners of a North Carolina winery), and Duplin Wine
				Cellars, another local vineyard.</p>
