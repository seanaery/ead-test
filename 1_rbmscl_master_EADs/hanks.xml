      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Nancy Hanks span the years 1894-1987
		  with the bulk occurring during the 1940s to 1983. Included
		  are correspondence; minutes; reports; typed, mimeographed,
		  and printed material; financial papers; clippings; mail
		  logs; telephone records; calendars; office files;
		  interviews, questionnaires; and diaries. In addition there
		  are scrapbooks, pictures, photograph albums, slides, audio
		  cassettes, videocassettes, and electronic documents. One
		  series contains awards, honorary degrees, and
		  memorabilia.</p>
      <p>The Nancy Hanks collection is useful as a study of
		  the development of private and governmental arts programs,
		  in particular through the National Endowment for the Arts
		  (NEA), and the personal life and career (1950s-1970s) of an
		  upper-class single woman. Arts and the federal government
		  is a recurrent theme. The collection also contains
		  information about a variety of arts organizations in which
		  Hanks was involved, often as a board member. Although the
		  papers here document both her personal and professional
		  life and present a balanced account, there are relatively
		  few professional papers in the collection concerning her
		  early career, 1951-1968.</p>
      <p>The private life of Nancy Hanks is chiefly
		  documented in the <emph render="bold">Personal
		  Series</emph>. Although there are no diaries in the
		  collection, the letters she wrote to her parents from the
		  1940s through the 1970s form a type of diary. This
		  correspondence in the <emph render="bold">Personal
		  Series</emph> often contains a detailed accounting of daily
		  events from her college years at Duke University, where she
		  majored in political science, and her early career in
		  Washington, D.C., through the NEA years. Letters from her
		  parents reveal their influence on her and often note their
		  advice to her. Other correspondence is from friends, some
		  during World War II, including extensive correspondence
		  from 1946 to 1949 with William A. Carpenter, a former
		  college friend. Other correspondents were Louis E. Reid,
		  1955-1961; John F. Watkins, 1949-1950; and Duke University
		  Dean of Chapel James T. Cleland, 1949-1969. The financial
		  papers in that series reveal her wealth, such as in real
		  estate and stocks, as well as her long illness. There are
		  gaps in the tax returns and bank statements from 1966-1975
		  and after 1979.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Duke University</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Bryan and Virginia Hanks</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Larry Hanks</emph>, and
		  <emph render="bold">Pictures Series</emph> all complete the
		  story. In the <emph render="bold">Duke University
		  Series</emph>, Hanks' financial contributions to the
		  university are documented, including the Hanks Family
		  Endowment Fund and the Hanks Family Chapel Fund.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Bryan and Virginia Hanks
		  Series</emph> and <emph render="bold">Larry Hanks
		  Series</emph> contain records of Hanks' parents, Bryan
		  Cayce Hanks, Virginia Wooding Hanks, and brother Lawrence
		  (Larry) Wooding Hanks. Included in the <emph render="bold">Bryan and Virginia Hanks Series</emph> are
		  late-nineteenth century documents, letters of Hanks' father
		  from France during World War I and from a Colorado
		  sanatarium, 1931-1932, as well as their courtship letters.
		  Bryan Hanks was a lawyer in New York, Miami, and Fort
		  Worth, and became president of Florida Power and Light
		  Company in 1937. Also there is some Hanks and Wooding
		  families history, including a few papers of Benjamin
		  Franklin Wooding, Nancy's maternal grandfather. He was a
		  medical doctor and inventor who developed an automatic
		  train control device and automatic block controls for
		  prevention of railroad accidents. The <emph render="bold">Larry Hanks Series</emph> tells the story of
		  the early death of Nancy Hanks' younger brother, who was
		  killed in a truck accident in California in June, 1950 at
		  the age of eighteen while a student at Southwestern
		  University.</p>
      <p>In this collection it is primarily the NEA portion
		  of Hanks' career, 1968-1977 during the Nixon and Ford
		  years, that is represented. However, there is some
		  information in the letters to Hanks' parents in the
		  <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> which reflects
		  her early work, 1951-1968. During her tenure at NEA there
		  were vast increases in NEA funding. The NEA was established
		  in 1965 with the National Endowment for the Humanities as
		  components of the National Foundation on the Arts and the
		  Humanities. In the <emph render="bold">National Endowment
		  for the Arts Series </emph>there is a narrative entitled,
		  "Ten Years for Tomorrow," which contains much biographical
		  information about Hanks' NEA years. While at NEA Hanks
		  delivered numerous speeches; in fact from 1971 to 1974 she
		  made about 100 addresses. These years are also documented
		  in the <emph render="bold">American Film Institute
		  (AFI)</emph>, <emph render="bold">Commission on Critical
		  Choices for Americans</emph>, and <emph render="bold">National Council on the Arts series</emph>,
		  which depict related responsibilities of Hanks. AFI files
		  document the organization's efforts to preserve the
		  heritage and art of both film and television in America.
		  National Council on the Arts files reflect programs in the
		  areas of architecture, dance, education, expansion arts,
		  literature, museums, music, visual arts, exhibitions, and
		  theater. The <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Pictures Series</emph>, and
		  <emph render="bold">Awards and Memorabilia Series</emph>
		  provide supplemental information. Letters Hanks wrote to
		  her parents as well as other correspondence and notes in
		  the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> relating to
		  the NEA show her continuing interest in the agency after
		  retirement. Related papers for the NEA are housed at the
		  National Archives.</p>
      <p>The alphabetical files in the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> document her board
		  work, memberships, and interest in a variety of
		  organizations and institutions, including those related to
		  the arts. They include the Awards in the Visual Arts,
		  Commission on Museums for a new Century, Continental Oil
		  Company (Conoco), the Conservation Foundation, the
		  Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., the
		  Independent Sector, the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on
		  Education and Culture, Partners for Livable Places, the
		  Phillips Collection, Presidential Task Force on the Arts
		  and Humanities, Salzburg Seminar in American Studies,
		  Scholastic, Inc., and Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
		  Institution. One measure of the public recognition of
		  Hanks' work is the fact that during 1970 to 1981 she
		  received 27 honorary doctoral degrees. The
		  <emph render="bold">National Endowment for the Arts
		  Series</emph> office files, <emph render="bold">Rockefeller
		  Brothers Fund Series</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> alphabetical files all
		  contain single folders for a variety of art, dance, and
		  music organizations.</p>
      <p>Papers relating to Nelson Rockefeller are
		  scattered throughout the collection. The
		  <emph render="bold">Rockefeller Brothers Fund Series</emph>
		  contains material relating to Nelson A., John D., 3rd, and
		  Laurance. In the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph>
		  is information on Nelson A. Rockefeller and the Rockefeller
		  Brothers Fund; Hanks' correspondence with her parents also
		  discusses her relationship with Nelson Rockefeller.</p>
      <p>There are papers in the collection that reflect
		  both Hanks' retirement years as well as activities of
		  colleagues after her death in 1983. One measure of Hanks'
		  post-NEA involvement is that in 1982 she was on the boards
		  of three corporations and a foundation, as well as being
		  trustee or advisor for 20 non-profit organizations. Related
		  materials are in the <emph render="bold">Rockefeller
		  Brothers Fund</emph> and <emph render="bold">Friends of the
		  Nancy Hanks Center, Inc. series</emph>. The papers of the
		  Rockefeller Brothers Fund, where Hanks was a vice chairman,
		  do not appear to provide a complete record of her work
		  there. These files are probably scattered ones that she
		  kept at home and often were not clearly defined. </p>
      <p> The U.S. government designated the Old Post
		  Office space on Pennsylvania Avenue as the Nancy Hanks
		  Center. The Friends of the Nancy Hanks Center was formed to
		  initiate programs commemorating Hanks' life and advancing
		  her values. Most of the interviews in this series were
		  conducted by Peter Jessup, but Donna Mitchell conducted a
		  number of them. Many of these interviews exist as
		  electronic files and are available to researchers. These
		  files are listed in the container list for the
		  <emph render="bold">Friends of the Nancy Hanks Center, Inc.
		  Series</emph>. </p>
      <p>A related collection in the Duke University
		  Special Collections Department is the Philip Hanes
		  collection. In addition, Hanes material appears in the
		  Hanks Papers in the <emph render="bold">Personal
		  Series</emph> both under his name and in the Awards in the
		  Visual Arts folders.</p>

				questionnaires, and
				<subject>Old Post Office building. </subject>
				Interviews and questionnaires arranged alphabetically by
				surname. Categories arranged alphabetically. Some
				interviews are restricted.</p>
          <p> Many of the interviews in this series also
				exist as electronic files dispersed throughout twenty-one
				computer disks. Disks were assigned consecutive numbers
				reflecting the original order in which they were received.
				If an interview has an identical electronic file(s), the
				file is included in the alphabetical list below. In such
				cases, the electronic file's name is listed, followed by
				the year of the interview, then the file's disk
				(subdirectory) name.</p>
          <p>The contents of each disk was migrated to the
				Specoll server. Consequently, the text of these electronic
				files is available in correspondingly numbered electronic
				subdirectories. Consult a reference archivist for access to
				the electronic files. </p>
