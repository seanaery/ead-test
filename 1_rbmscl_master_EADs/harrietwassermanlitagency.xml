      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Harriet Wasserman Literary Agency (HWLA) was
		  formed in 1981 by Harriet Wasserman, formerly an agent at
		  the Russell and Volkening Literary Agency beginning in
		  1965. A number of prominent American writers Wasserman
		  represented at Russell and Volkening came with her when she
		  formed her own agency. Thus, while the bulk of the HWLA
		  records document her clients' careers after 1981, a number
		  also reach back into the 1970s and document such early
		  clients as Saul Bellow, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and Reynolds
		  Price.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The records of the Harriet Wasserman Literary
		  Agency span the dates 1948-1993, with most of the records
		  dating after 1974. The records dated prior to 1981, when
		  the agency was formed, are those of writers who were
		  Wasserman's clients when she was employed at the Russell
		  and Volkening agency and stayed with her when she formed
		  her own agency. The collection documents the careers of
		  individual writers and in doing so indicates the varied
		  activities of a major literary agency: preparation and
		  submission of manuscripts, negotiation of contracts,
		  handling of foreign and reprint rights, publicity, and the
		  differing ways affairs are handled for lesser known or
		  beginning writers and for major authors. Among the more
		  prominent American fiction writers included are Richard
		  Bausch, Saul Bellow, Frederick Buechner, Oscar Hijuelos,
		  Josephine Humphreys, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Alice McDermott,
		  and Reynolds Price. In addition, records about historian
		  George F. Kennan and philosopher and historian Allan Bloom
		  are included. The correspondence is primarily about
		  professional matters, although some sense of the personal
		  relationships between the agent and the more prominent
		  clients can be gleaned.</p>
      <p>By far, the Bellow papers comprise the largest
		  group relating to any single author, and cover the longest
		  span of years, from 1948 to 1993. There are relatively few
		  papers from 1948 to 1972, but those present contain a few
		  personal letters to Bellow from his contemporaries such as
		  the novelists Ralph Ellison and Wright Morris. The bulk of
		  the Bellow papers date from 1973, and convey a clear
		  impression of the activity surrounding his increasing fame,
		  particularly with the publication of Humboldt's Gift, the
		  1975 Pulitzer Prize for that novel, and the Nobel Prize in
		  Literature in 1976. After that date his later career is
		  sketched in detail and follows from inception through
		  publication such works as 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">The Dean's December,</title><title linktype="simple" render="italic">More Die of
		  Heartbreak,</title> and 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">It All Adds Up.</title></p>
      <p>The collection includes, in smaller amounts,
		  material about the careers of other authors. In the current
		  accession, the Bausch and Jhabvala papers are particularly
		  rich among the fiction writers. Bausch's career is outlined
		  from his breaking into the profession in the mid-1970s to
		  his establishment as a major author by the late 1980s.
		  Jhabvala's papers pick up in mid-career, when she has
		  already published several novels and won the Booker Prize
		  in England, but prior to her growing fame as a screenwriter
		  for Merchant Ivory Productions. Her correspondence also
		  includes a number of letters from director James Ivory and
		  producer Ismail Merchant, particularly relating to the
		  development of the film 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">The Autobiography of a
		  Princess</title> (1975) and the accompanying photography
		book of the same name.</p>
      <p>Of special note are the records about Reynolds
		  Price and Josephine Humphreys. While the HWLA collection
		  contains some unique items about these writers, especially
		  Price, scholars should be aware that the Library is also
		  the primary repository for the personal papers of these
		  writers. Much more information is available in their
		  respective collections.</p>
      <p>Among non-fiction writers in the current (1995)
		  accession, the papers of historian George F. Kennan and
		  philosopher Allan Bloom document their careers in the
		  1980s. Most of the Bloom papers relate to the publicity
		  surrounding the publication of 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">The Closing of the American
		  Mind,</title> particularly reviews and speaking
		engagements. The Kennan material is more varied, including
		not only Wasserman's correspondence on Kennan's behalf, but
		several dozen lengthy letters from Kennan to Wasserman and
		others.</p>
      <p>The 1999 addition (accession #1999-0275) (19,500
		  items, 32.5 lin. ft.; dated 1974-1999 and undated) is
		  minimally processed. It expands on all of the collection
		  series, especially materials related to Saul Bellow.</p>
      <p>The 2001 addition (accession #2001-0050) (816
		  items, 12 lin. ft.; dated 1974-2000 and undated) is minimally
		  processed. It includes book manuscripts, galley proofs
		  (some inscribed), correspondence, notes, and other
		  materials relating to the authors represented by the
		  literary agency. Other materials include sixty-four
		  black-and-white photographs, one black-and-white negative,
		  four color photographs, and one audiocassette tape. Authors
		  included in this addition are Richard Bausch, Jay Williams,
		  Suzi-Lori Parks, Laurel Lee, Karla Kuskin, Elinore Clark,
		  Perrin Ireland, Frederick Buechner, John Tyler Bonner,
		  Martha Moody, Eugene Walter, Caroline Winthrop, Paul

		  Winegardner, Michael Stewart, Diane Vreuls, Sandra Gould
		  Ford, Charles McPhee, Mark Smith, and Harriet Wasserman
		  herself.</p>
      <p>The second 2001 addition (accession #2001-0115) (5
		  items, .1 linear feet; dated 1978-2001, bulk 1997-2001) is
		  minimally processed. It contains correspondence between
		  Wasserman and Shelley Gruskin. It also includes a playbill
		  for performances of 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">In Dreams Begin
		  Responsibilities</title> and 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">Gimpel the Fool,</title>
		signed by actor David Marguiles and a copy of Delmore
		Schwartz's 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">In Dreams Begin
		  Responsibilities and Other Stories.</title> Both book and
		playbill are mentioned in the correspondence.</p>
      <p>The 2003 addition (accession #2003-0051)(12,500
		  items, 30 linear feet, dated 1982-2000) is minimally
		  processed. It consists chiefly of client files
		  (correspondence, contracts, financial records, etc.),
		  manuscripts and proofs of books by clients, published
		  versions of books by clients, and related materials.
		  Includes especially significant material for Saul Bellow
		  and a few other authors, including Oscar Hijuelos and
		  George Frost Kennan.</p>
	<p>Addition (08-004) (18,000 items; 24 lin. ft.; dated 1984-2006) consists chiefly of client files (correspondence, contracts, financial records, etc.), manuscripts and proofs of books by clients, published versions clients, and related materials.

          <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
				Series</emph> is divided into two subseries,
				<emph render="bold">Restricted</emph> and
				<emph render="bold">Open.</emph> The correspondence in both subseries consists of letters to and from Wasserman and her staff chiefly concerning the professional affairs of
				various writers represented by the agency: contract
				negotiations, auctions, publicity, and discussions of
				writing progress. Correspondence is predominantly about
				rather than from the writers, although the papers of
				some--notably Richard Bausch, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, George
				Kennan, and Reynolds Price--contain a number of their own
				letters.</p>

            <p>The restricted correspondence is mainly that
				  of authors for whom the Library did not do item-level
				  processing at this time (see <emph render="bold">Processing
				  Note</emph> and <emph render="bold">Restrictions)</emph>.
				  Additionally, a few of the restricted papers are
				  correspondence about unpublished works by major authors, the bulk of whose correspondence is open. ENTIRE SUBSERIES IS RESTRICTED.</p>

            <p>The <emph render="bold">Open
				  subseries</emph> is mainly the correspondence of authors
				  for whom the Library decided to do item-level processing
				  (see <emph render="bold">Processing Note and
				  Restrictions</emph>). In addition it contains the
				  correspondence of three authors processed at the folder
				  level, Allan Bloom, Coral Lansbury, and Anne Lindbergh.
				  Since these authors are already deceased, financial papers
				  and documents about unpublished works were not restricted
				  and thus not separated from other correspondence.</p>
            <p>A few folders in the Saul Bellow
				  correspondence are of special note. The folders for his
				  early correspondence, mainly prior to 
				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1970" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate>,
				  contain, in addition to correspondence from the Russell and
				  Volkening Agency, a few substantive letters from prominent
				  writers, most notably American novelists Ralph Ellison and
				  Wright Morris. This also applies to a later group of
				  folders, <emph render="bold">1985. Lois Phillips
				  Files</emph>. In the 
				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1980/1989" type="inclusive">1980s</unitdate>
				  Lois Phillips discovered these files in a house near hers
				  that Bellow lived in from the late 
				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1950/1959" type="inclusive">1950s</unitdate>
				  to the early 
				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1960/1969" type="inclusive">1960s</unitdate>.
				  Like other of his papers from that period, they contain
				  some personal correspondence from writers. Because of the
				  way in which these papers were found and the correspondence
				  in the 
				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1980/1989" type="inclusive">1980s</unitdate>
				  between Phillips and Harriet Wasserman about their
				  disposition, correspondence and financial papers were kept
				  together chronologically in their respective series rather
				  than separated and refiled to the time period in which they
				  were written.</p>

          <p>This series consists mainly of the financial
				papers of those authors whose correspondence was selected
				for item-level processing (see <emph render="bold">Processing Note and Restrictions</emph>). In
				addition it contains the papers of a number of authors who
				had contracts with the Russell and Volkening Agency. Since
				these had been stored separately by HWLA, they were placed
				as received in this series. All of the financial papers are
				closed during the lifetime of the authors. It should be
				noted that since the authors Allan Bloom, Coral Lansbury,
				and Anne Lindbergh died before the Library acquired the
				Wasserman collection, their financial papers are open and
				were not separated from the correspondence. Refer to the
				<emph render="bold">Correspondence (Open) Subseries</emph>
				for access to their papers.</p>

            <p>This subseries consists of authors'
				  published book length works. Included are first American
				  editions and paperbacks, translations, special or limited
				  editions, uncorrected bound proofs, and some seventy books
				  with acknowledgements, dedications, and/or inscriptions to
				  Harriet Wasserman (N.B.: see under Wasserman's name in the
				  <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous (Open) Subseries</emph>
				  for photocopies of these pages). A count and brief summary
				  of editions is given after each title. The absence of this
				  summary indicates that there is a single copy of an
				  American hardback edition with no acknowledgement,
				  dedication, or inscription. The entire subseries of about
				  840 items is open. For unbound proofs or published versions
				  with authors' handwritten corrections, see the
