      <p>Stanley Hauerwas is the Gilbert T. Rowe Professor
		  of Theological Ethics in the Duke divinity School as well
		  as Professor in the Duke School of Law. He came to Duke in
		  1984 after serving on the faculties of the University of
		  Notre Dame and Augustana College. He has published ten
		  books and many articles dealing with a variety of topics,
		  many of them interdisciplinary, centering on moral
		  discourse within the contemporary Christian community. Two
		  recent books are 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">A Better Hope: Resources for a
		  Church Confronting Capitalism, Democracy, and
		  Postmodernity</title> (2000) and 
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">Dispatches from the Front:
		  Theological Engagements with the Secular </title>(1994).
		His work is typically non-denominational and often
		provocative and controversial. Hauerwas was named America's Best Theologian by TIME Magazine in 2001, and was the first American in 40 years to deliver the Gifford Lectureship at St. Andrew's College, also in 2001.</p>
