		<head>Collection Overview</head>
		<p>The <emph render="bold">Kensinger Jones Papers, 1934-2001,</emph>
		  document Jones's primary career as an executive for several major advertising
		  agencies, including Leo Burnett Company, Campbell-Ewald Company, D.P. Brother
		  and Company, Wilding Advertising, and William R.Biggs/Gilmore Associates; and
		  his second career as a professor of advertising at Michigan State University.
		  Materials consist primarily of correspondence, memoranda, notes, reports,
		  scripts, and audiovisual materials that document the development of print,
		  radio, and television advertising campaigns for a wide variety of clients. The
		  history and management of advertising companies in Chicago and Detroit in the
		  United States, in Australia, and in Singapore is also represented. Major
		  clients documented include Chevrolet, the Florida Citrus Commission, General
		  Motors Corporation, and Oldsmobile. </p>
		<p>The <emph render="bold">Advertising Agencies Series, </emph>the
		  largest, includes memoranda and correspondence related to the executive
		  management of each agency and Jones's role in organizing and directing the
		  creative activities of the agency or advertising team. Materials from Jones's
		  work at the Leo Burnett Company consist primarily of office memoranda and
		  weekly progress reports for radio and television commercials for clients such
		  as: Mars, Incorporated; Kellogg Company; and the Green Giant Company. In
		  Southeast Asia, Jones served as Regional Creative Director for Leo Burnett
		  offices in Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Materials
		  include correspondence, speeches for creative seminars, and scripts for two
		  films for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. Jones worked mainly with
		  clients in the automotive industry, specifically Chevrolet at the
		  Campbell-Ewald Company and Oldsmobile at D.P. Brother Company (as well as at
		  Leo Burnett). Materials about General Motors relate to the potential of
		  television specials for corporate advertising to promote the GM "Mark of
		  Excellence" and the corporation's responsiveness to environmental and safety
		  issues in the late sixties and seventies. Closely related to the Advertising
		  Agencies Series, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence and Memoranda Series
		  </emph>consists of carbons of outgoing correspondence from Jones, filed in
		  chronological order with some memoranda.</p>
		<p>Nearly a third of the collection pertains to Jones's tenure from
		  1982-1995 as Lecturer in the Department of Advertising, the School of
		  Communication Arts at Michigan State University. The <emph render="bold">Michigan State University (MSU) Series </emph>includes
		  correspondence with colleagues and students, materials from academic
		  conferences and MSU's Visiting Advertising Professional program, as well as
		  copies of
		<title linktype="simple" render="doublequote">Impact,</title> the alumni
		newsletter for the Advertising Department. Of particular note are materials
		related to China and Taiwan in 1988 and 1990. The <emph render="bold">Course
		Materials Subseries </emph>details his advanced courses in creative
		advertising. In order to create a realistic, professional experience for the
		students, Jones assigned group projects that required students to create
		advertising campaigns or marketing strategies for national or state clients,
		local businesses, and university departments, including Archway Cookies,
		Oldsmobile, McDonalds, American Tourister, the Muskegon County Museum, and
		several MSU facilities and departments. The projects were presented to the
		class and evaluated not only by the client and Professor Jones, but also by the
		other students.</p>
		<p>Throughout his life, Jones considered himself primarily to be a
		  writer, and the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series
		  </emph>reflects Jones's lifelong writing efforts. The series includes a wide
		  variety of professional, personal, and unpublished writing: advertising
		  presentations, speeches, articles, advertising seminars, scripts for radio
		  programs and plays, poetry, an unpublished novel, and an autobiography. The
		  <emph render="bold">Speeches Subseries </emph>and <emph render="bold">Published
		  Articles Subseries </emph>document his creativity in advertising and his
		  contributions to the industry as well as to local schools and organizations.
		  Material in the <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> demonstrates his
		  activities with professional and civic organizations; in addition this series
		  contains personal correspondence and materials about the life and career of Leo
		  Burnett.</p>
		<p>Much of Jones's creative work in advertising was produced for the
		  broadcast media, especially the early days of television advertising in the
		  1950s and 1960s. The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series
		  </emph>includes film and sound materials that document television advertising
		  and Jones's creative contributions to the professional education of his
		  advertising colleagues. Because several of his most successful films about
		  advertising or creativity originated as speeches with slides, these materials
		  are particularly rich in conjunction with related materials in the
		  <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series.</emph></p>

				<p> Arranged alphabetically by major subject categories that
				  correspond to Jones's work as Creative Director and Executive Vice-President.
				  Major accounts include Chevrolet, General Motors, Florida Citrus Commission,
				  and other new business prospects. Many of the files pertain to the operation
				  and reorganization of the Creative Department as well as the management of the
				  agency, when Jones served on the Executive Committee. Several Chevrolet film
				  commercials won awards at notable advertising competitions. The papers also
				  reflect Jones's focus on professional development -- coordinating seminars
				  within the agency, writing articles, and presenting workshops with state,
				  regional, and national advertising organizations. One effort resulted in the
				<title linktype="simple" render="doublequote">Creativity</title>
				film, later renamed the
				<title linktype="simple" render="doublequote">Horse and the

				<title linktype="simple" render="doublequote">Whatever Happened to

				<p>Arranged chronologically by academic quarter and by course, the
				  <emph render="bold">Course Materials Subseries</emph> pertains primarily to two
				  advanced courses: Advertising 417-"Advanced Creative Strategy and Execution"
				  and Advertising 441-"TV-Radio Advertising." For most courses, Jones taught over
				  fifty students, divided into two sections. Other courses include: Advertising
				  317-"Creative Strategy and Execution" and after 1989-1990, Advertising
				  492-"Advanced Copywriting." For each course, a "Course Materials" folder
				  typically includes a syllabus, a midterm and final exam, and for the later
				  years, a coursepak of readings. </p>
				<p>Subsequent course folders pertain to student projects and are
				  titled with the name and location of the particular advertising client or
				  product assigned for the course. Materials typically include: 1) background
				  information on the client or product; 2) student reports often with creative
				  illustrations and sample advertising; 3) evaluations of the group presentations
				  by the client, by Jones, and by the other students; and 4) peer evaluations of
				  individual contributions to the group. During some courses, students produced
				  video or audio tapes. On occasion, selected student projects were presented at
				  state or regional competitions. (A folder at the beginning of this subseries
				  contains chronological and alphabetical listings of the student project
				  assignments.)</p>
