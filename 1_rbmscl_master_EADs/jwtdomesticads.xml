		<head>Historical Note</head>
		<p>Beginning in 1919 the New York Office of the J. Walter Thompson
		  Company began to systematically retain the advertisements it had created. The
		  Statistical and Information Department, renamed the Information and Records
		  Department in the 1920s, arranged the advertisements in scrapbooks. Initially,
		  most of the advertisements preserved were tear sheets, the actual
		  advertisements clipped from newspapers and magazines. By the 1930s, however,
		  the department retained the final printers' proofs for magazine advertisements.
		  The scrapbooks therefore began to be called <emph render="doublequote">proof
		  books.</emph></p>
		<p>In the 1950s the responsibility for creating proof books fell to
		  individual account groups. In addition to the account group proof books, a file
		  clerk under the supervision of the Traffic Department maintained proofs. When
		  no longer of current use, the file clerk transferred the proofs to a storeroom
		  or records center. Throughout these years, individuals who helped create
		  campaigns or who managed an account sometimes would maintain personal proof
		  books.</p>
		<p>In 1977 the New York Office established a Creative Library. Its
		  responsibilities included the preservation on microfilm of all print
		  advertisements, which was done for most of the 1980s. Imprints are located in
		  the JWT Microfilm Collection; the originals were apparently destroyed after
		  microfilming. The Creative Library has made an effort to create files of work
		  from all major U.S. offices, so work from Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los
		  Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., is better represented in the
		  collection from the late 1970s and after. Where known, the office that created
		  the advertisements is noted in the container list. In addition, JWT
		  subsidiaries such as Brouillard Communications or Lord Geller Federico and
		  Einstein (LGFE) are noted where their work has been identified. </p>

		<head>Collection Overview</head>
		<p>The <emph render="bold">Domestic Advertisements Collection</emph>
		  consists of print advertisements created by U.S. offices of the
		  <corpname>J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT).</corpname> The bulk of the
		  collection dates from the 1920s and after, but a few examples are available
		  from as early as 1875. Print advertisements appear in a variety of
		  formats--magazine, newspaper, color, black-and-white, proofs, tearsheets,
		  negative transfers, clippings, along with a limited number of sketches for
		  outdoor advertising installations. Some of the advertisements feature work from
		  notable artists, such as
		  <persname>Norman Rockwell</persname>, and photographers like
		  <persname>Edward Steichen</persname>,
		  <persname>Irving Penn</persname>, and
		  <persname>Baron De Meyer</persname>. In addition to the actual
		  advertisements, the files dating from the 1910s to 1950s often contain
		  <emph render="doublequote">insertion schedules</emph> that provide the dates
		  and names of the magazines or newspapers in which a given advertisement
		  appeared. In general, proofs for JWT's long-time clients have been saved more
		  systematically than those for accounts that JWT did not hold for a long time.
		  The collection does not include advertisements which have been transferred to
		  microfilm (see the JWT Microfilm Collection). Also, advertisements created for
		  clients that JWT lost prior to the 1940s are less likely to have been saved,
		  although some were microfilmed and are still available in that form. For some
		  JWT clients there are no print advertisements at all in this collection. Among
		  the most extensive files of print advertisements are those for the following
		  JWT clients:
		  <corpname>Champion Spark Plug</corpname>,
		  <corpname>Chesebrough-Ponds</corpname>,
		  <corpname>Eastman Kodak</corpname> (Instamatic, Pocket Instamatic, and
		  Disc cameras, Kodak film),
		  <corpname>Ford Motor Company</corpname> (consumer and dealer
		  advertisements),
		  <corpname>R.T. French</corpname>,
		  <corpname>Irving Trust Bank</corpname>,
		  <corpname>J. Walter Thompson Company</corpname> (<emph render="doublequote">house advertisements</emph>),
		  <corpname>Kraft Foods</corpname> (including Kraft cheeses, Miracle
		  Whip, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Velveeta),
		  <corpname>Lever Brothers</corpname> (Lifebuoy, Lux, Close Up, Mrs.
		  Butterworth),
		  <corpname>Pan American World Airways</corpname> (passenger jet travel,
		  cargo transportation),
		  <corpname>Radio Corporation of America (RCA)</corpname> (RCA Victor
		  recordings, consumer goods, National Broadcasting Company),
		<title linktype="simple" render="italic">Reader's Digest</title>,
		<corpname>Scott Paper</corpname>,
		<corpname>Seven-Up</corpname>,
		<corpname>Standard Brands</corpname> (Chase and Sandborn, Fleischmann,
		Royal, Tenderleaf tea), and
		<corpname>Warner-Lambert</corpname> (primarily Listerine, including
		advertisements produced by the
		<corpname>Lambert and Feasley</corpname> agency). </p>
		<p>The Collection is organized into three series--Main Files, Small
		  Files, and Oversize Materials--that reflect both the size of the holdings for
		  each client as well as the physical location of the advertisements. Within each
		  series, clients are arranged alphabetically and then the advertisements are
		  arranged chronologically. The <emph render="bold">Main File Series</emph>
		  includes clients for which at least one box have been preserved. A separate
		  <emph render="bold">Small Files Series</emph> is maintained for clients for
		  which less than one box of advertisements, and often much less, has survived.
		  The <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials Series</emph> includes many of the
		  clients found in both the <emph render="bold">Main</emph> and
		  <emph render="bold">Small Files Series</emph>. </p>
	 </scopecontent>
	 <processinfo>
		<p>A supplementary container list provides greater intellectual access by
		  rearranging the alphabetically-sequenced clients of this list into broad
		  product categories. It is appended to this document. </p>

		  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1875/1968" type="inclusive">1875-1968.</unitdate> Proofs from the 1920s to 1950s feature
		  testimonial advertising for Pond's Cold Cream. Noted socialites endorsing the
		  product were photographed by well known photographers, including
		  <persname>Edward J. Steichen</persname> and
		  <persname>Baron DeMeyer</persname>.</p>
		<p>
		  <corpname><emph render="bold">Eastman Kodak Company, </emph></corpname>

		  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1930" type="inclusive">1930-present</unitdate>. Organized into two
		  categories--Consumer and Trade advertisements--that correspond to Kodak's two
		  major marketing areas. Consumer advertisements feature photographs by well
		  known photographers, famous slogans and trademarks, and depict the American
		  family over several decades in settings where the cameras are used.
		  Introductions of new camera models are well represented, including the
		  Instamatic in 1963, the Pocket Instamatic in 1972, the Instant camera in 1975,
		  and the Disc camera in 1982. At different times JWT handled both film and
		  cameras (still and/or movie) or just Kodak films. Trade advertisements include
		  campaigns for medical and industrial films, Kodel fibers, and Eastman Chemical,
		  as well as advertisements aimed at Kodak dealers. Additional Kodak advertising
		  may be found in the <emph render="bold">Wayne P. Ellis Collection of
		  Kodakiana</emph>.</p>
		<p>

		  the <emph render="doublequote">Peanuts</emph> campaign (1960-1962) and the
		  launch of the Mustang (1964). In addition to print advertisements showing the
		  introduction of new models, photostats of outdoor billboards in the 1940s and
		  early 1950s are included. Truck and dealer advertising can also be found. A
		  separate collection, the JWT Detroit Office's Ford <emph render="doublequote">Collateral Literature,</emph> houses showroom brochures,

		  Lifebuoy Soap. J. Walter Thompson Co. introduced Lux Flakes in 1915 and
		  <corpname>Lux Toilet Soap</corpname> in 1925. The early
		  <corpname>Lux Flakes</corpname> advertisements employed the talents of
		  fine illustrators. Comic style advertising appeared in the 1930s (<emph render="doublequote">Peggy Lux</emph> and others). The Lux Toilet Soap
		  campaigns began featuring movie and stage star testimonials in 1927. One
		  noteworthy campaign dates from 1953-1954 when
		  <persname>Irving Penn</persname> photographed some of Hollywood's most
		  famous stars. The Lever Brothers advertisements for both Lux products also
		  include photographs of car cards (subway and bus posters) from the 1920s. Other

		  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1915/1997" type="inclusive">1915-1997</unitdate>. Advertisements consist primarily of
		  proofs and tearsheets. There are no advertisements present for the years
		  1945-1947 or 1949. The vast majority of the advertisements are for Listerine
		  Antiseptic, with other products represented beginning in the late 1960s.
		  Listerine was manufactured by the
		  <corpname>Lambert Pharmacal Company</corpname> beginning around 1915.
		  William Warner acquired the company in 1955, merged it into his own
		  pharmaceutical business and changed the name to the Warner-Lambert Co.</p>
		<p> Warner-Lambert is the only client file in this collection that
		  includes the work of an agency other than JWT. Until 1962, Listerine
		  advertising was handled by the
		  <corpname>Lambert and Feasley</corpname> agency in New York, the house
		  agency for the
		  <corpname>Lambert Pharmacal Co. </corpname>(St. Louis) up to 1955, and
		  for its successor the Warner-Lambert Co. (Morris Plains, N.J.), from 1955-1962.
		  When JWT obtained the Listerine account in October 1962, the back files of
		  Listerine advertisements were transferred to JWT.</p>

				<p>Organized into two categories--Consumer and Trade
				  advertisements--that correspond to Kodak's two major marketing areas. Consumer
				  advertisements feature photographs by well known photographers, famous slogans
				  and trademarks, and depict the American family over several decades in settings
				  where the cameras are used. Introductions of new camera models are well
				  represented, including the Instamatic in 1963, the Pocket Instamatic in 1972,
				  the Instant camera in 1975, and the Disc camera in 1982. At different times JWT
				  handled both film and cameras (still and/or movie) or just Kodak films. Trade
				  advertisements include campaigns for medical and industrial films, Kodel
				  fibers, and Eastman Chemical, as well as advertisements aimed at Kodak dealers.
				  </p>
				<p> Eastman Kodak advertising is also represented in various other
				  collections: JWT Account Files (includes films and videos plus account
				  information); Wayne P. Ellis Collection of Kodakiana</p>

				<p>This category provides extensive documentation of the trade
				  oriented advertisements from the Eastman Kodak Company from 1931-1990. Although
				  formal division titles changed slightly throughout the company's history,
				  general markets consistently advertised include: </p>
				<p> Medical, including dental and radiography; chemical, including
				  chemicals, plastics, and cellulose divisions; business reproductions, including
				  Recordak; Tennessee Eastman, including Eastman Chemicals and Eastman Fibers
				  (Kodel); industrial photography, including engineering and functional
				  photography; motion pictures; business premiums; and pharmaceutical trade,
				  probably the least represented. </p>
				<p> International advertisements may be found as early as 1961
				  randomly included and continuing throughout the collection for various years.
				  The majority of advertisements are proofs; very few tearsheets appear. Prior to
				  the 1960s, the physical condition of the advertisements varies from poor to
				  good with many advertisements still attached to black scrapbook paper. The
				  remaining advertisements were not initially stored in the scrapbooks;
				  therefore, they range from good to very good physical condition. The quantity
				  for any given year varies somewhat; however, the following years have a minimal
				  number of advertisements: 1966-1967, 1970, 1972-1973. </p>

				<p>Key campaigns include <emph render="doublequote">There's a Ford
				  in Your Future</emph> (1945-1948), the <emph render="doublequote">Peanuts</emph> campaign (1960-1962) and the launch of the
				  Mustang (1964). In addition to print advertisements showing the introduction of
				  new models, photostats of outdoor billboards in the 1940s and early 1950s are
				  included. Truck and dealer advertising can also be found throughout the years.
				  </p>
				<p> Additional information and documentation for the Ford account
				  may be found in other collections including: <emph render="bold">JWT Co.
				  Newsletters</emph>, <emph render="bold">Winfield Taylor Papers</emph>,
				  <emph render="bold">Norman Strouse Papers</emph> (a small collection),
				  <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial Documents</emph>, and
				  <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Ford
				  Collateral Literature</emph> files include showroom brochures, and diverse
				  sales materials in many formats</p>
				<p> Folders marked <emph render="bold">cars</emph> do not include
				  any model that has its own folder for a particular year.
				  <emph render="doublequote">Cars</emph> include station wagons and minivans.
				  Aerostar is a minivan after 1986.</p>
				<p> Folders marked <emph render="bold">trucks</emph> include all
				  truck sizes unless there is a folder specifically for <emph render="bold">medium/heavy duty trucks</emph>, in which case the
				  <emph render="doublequote">trucks</emph> folder would contain light trucks
				  (Ranger, F series, etc. pickups). Bronco is classified as both a truck
				  (1966-1989) and an SUV (1990-).</p>
				<p><emph render="doublequote">Vans</emph> includes RVs, conversion
				  and 15 passenger vans, but not minivans.</p>
				<p> Throughout this list, <emph render="doublequote">General</emph>
				  folders refers to car advertising for Ford cars in general or more than one
				  model in a given ad. </p>

				<p>The earliest advertisements are for Lifebuoy Soap. J. Walter
				  Thompson Co. introduced Lux Flakes in 1915 and
				  <corpname>Lux Toilet Soap</corpname> in 1925. The early
				  <corpname>Lux Flakes</corpname> advertisements employed the
				  talents of fine illustrators. Comic style advertising appeared in the 1930s
				  (<emph render="doublequote">Peggy Lux</emph> and others). The Lux Toilet Soap
				  campaigns began featuring movie and stage star testimonials in 1927. One
				  noteworthy campaign dates from 1953-1954 when
				  <persname>Irving Penn</persname> photographed some of Hollywood's
				  most famous stars. The Lever Brothers advertisements for both Lux products also
				  include photographs of car cards (subway and bus posters) from the 1920s. Other
				  Lever Products include
				  <corpname>Stripe</corpname> and
				  <corpname>Close Up</corpname> toothpastes,
				  <corpname>Mrs. Butterworth syrup</corpname>, and
				  <corpname>Lever 2000</corpname> bath soap.</p>

				<p>Proofs and tearsheets. There are no advertisements present for
				  the years 1945-1947 or 1949. The vast majority of the advertisements are for
				  Listerine Antiseptic, with other products represented beginning in the late
				  1960s. Listerine was manufactured by the
				  <corpname>Lambert Pharmacal Company</corpname> beginning around
				  1915. William Warner acquired the company in 1955, merged it into his own
				  pharmaceutical business and changed the name to the Warner-Lambert Co.</p>
				<p> This file is the only one in the J. Walter Thompson Company
				  Domestic Advertisements Collection that includes the work of an agency other
				  than JWT. Until 1962, Listerine advertising was handled by the
				  <corpname>Lambert and Feasley</corpname> agency in New York, the
				  house agency for the
				  <corpname>Lambert Pharmacal Co. </corpname>(St. Louis), up to
				  1955 and for its successor, the Warner-Lambert Co. (Morris Plains, N.J.), from
				  1955-1962. When JWT obtained the Listerine account in October 1962, the back
				  files of Listerine advertisements were transferred to JWT.</p>
