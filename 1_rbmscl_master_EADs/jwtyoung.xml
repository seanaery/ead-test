			<p>In addition to his roles in the J. Walter Thompson Company, Young developed for the
				Creel Committee for Public Information a propaganda plan to be implemented on the
				Western Front during World War I and held a number of public and private positions,
				including President of the Board of Trustees of the Laboratory of Anthropology,
				Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>

			<head>Collection Overview</head>
			<p>The James Webb Young Papers chiefly consist of correspondence, memoranda, reports,
				and publications and span the years 1927-1984. These materials provide insights into
				Young's career as well as the operational aspects of the J. Walter Thompson Company,
				especially the early development of their international branch offices.</p>
			<p>From the perspective of James Webb Young's entire career in advertising, this
				collection reflects a small portion of his contributions to the J. Walter Thompson
				Company and the advertising business as a whole, for which he was awarded in 1945
				the Gold Medal for a distinguished career in advertising. While these papers
				represent Young's pioneering work in establishing the J. Walter Thompson Company
				abroad as well as reflect some his contributions to public service advertising and
				advertising strategy, primarily through <title linktype="simple" render="italic">The
					Compleat Angler,</title>
				<title linktype="simple" render="italic">A Footnote to History,</title> and other
				works in the Publications category, they are an incomplete record of his
				distinguished career.</p>
			<p>The International Branch Notebooks category primarily contains correspondence,
				minutes, memoranda, research reports and tables which pertain to the organization
				and initial operations of J. Walter Thompson branch offices abroad, particularly in
				London, Africa, South America, and Europe during the late 1920s and early 1930s. A
				substantial amount of this material focuses upon J. Walter Thompson's advertising
				for General Motors, especially for markets in Europe and South America. Though Young
				officially retired in 1928, he served as Consultant and director (1928-1964) and
				became a key figure in establishing the earliest international branch offices for
				the J. Walter Thompson Company. Among the correspondents in this series are Sam
				Meek, Stanley Resor, and Henry C. Flowers.</p>
			<p>In the Publications category are works written by Young, some of which were privately
				printed by the Piñon Press in Coapa, New Mexico. The works published by the Piñon
				Press have been individually cataloged and can be searched by author and title. The
				Publications category includes editions of <title linktype="simple" render="italic"
					>A Technique for Producing Ideas</title> and <title linktype="simple"
					render="italic">How to Become an Advertising Man.</title> As a whole, these
				works reflect aspects of Young's advertising philosophy and strategies, and
				partially document his involvement in public service advertising in the United
				States as well as his early career from an autobiographical perspective. </p>
