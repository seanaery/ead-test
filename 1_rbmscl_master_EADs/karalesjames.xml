      <abstract encodinganalog="520">The collection spans the years 1953 to 2006 and houses a nearly-complete photographic archive of photojournalist James Karales, active from the 1950s to the 1980s. The majority of the images in the collection originated from Karales' documentary work for <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine during the 1960s.  His major projects include images from Rendville, Ohio, a coal mining town and one of the first racially integrated towns in Appalachia; Vietnam during the war; New York's Lower East Side; Oregon logging; and individuals and events of the Civil Rights movement during the 1960s, housed in three inter-related groups - the Martin Luther King, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and Civil Rights Series.  Other smaller projects include images of California, New Mexico, and other subjects.  Formats in the collection include contact sheets, which serve as a thumbnail guide to almost all of the prints and negatives in the collection; black-and-white proof prints and finished prints ranging from 8.5x14 to 16x20 inches; original negatives (closed to research use); and over 1100 color slides. There are also many print materials and some correspondence and audiovisual materials.  Acquired by the Center of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <p>James H. Karales was born in Canton, Ohio in 1930.  In 1955, Karales graduated from Ohio University with BFA in photography.  Upon graduation, he began a mentorship with W. Eugene Smith, who at that time was printing his Pittsburg photographs. Karales learned printing skills under Smith, while pursuing his own projects in Rendville and the Pacific Northwest.  In 1960, he joined the staff at <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine, where he worked until it ceased publication in 1971. At <title render="italic">Look</title>, he took some of his most iconic pictures, documenting Martin Luther King, Jr., the Selma to Montgomery civil rights march, Vietnam and the Lower East Side.  Karales receieved numerous awards, such as the Overseas Press Club Award and the Picture of the Year.

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection spans the years 1953 to 2006 and houses a nearly complete photographic archive of well-known 20th century American photojournalist James Karales.  The majority of the images in the collection originated from Karales' documentary work for <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine during the 1960s.  The collection is organized around the following project series: <emph render="bold">Rendville, Ohio</emph>, a declining coal mining town and one of the first racially integrated towns in Appalachia; <emph render="bold">Vietnam</emph>, where Karales documented many scenes from the Vietnam War - the largest series in the collection; the <emph render="bold">Lower East Side</emph>, featuring street scenes and portraits from that New York City neighborhood; and <emph render="bold">Logging</emph>, where Karales documented the Pacific Northwest logging industry's practices and culture. Finally, Karales also shot many images of individuals and events of the Civil Rights movement during the 1960s, housed in three inter-related groups: the <emph render="bold">Martin Luther King Series</emph>; <emph render="bold">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Series</emph>; and the <emph render="bold">Civil Rights Series</emph>.</p>

	    <p>There is also a small group of supporting materials in the <emph render="bold">Manuscript and Printed Materials Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> that includes biographical documents such as Karales' curriculum vitae; Karales' essays on photography and teaching; publicity for exhibits and other events; correspondence with publishers; digitized images of Vietnam photos on a CD; and clippings, <genreform>magazine layouts</genreform>, and other materials related to Karales' published work.  One recently dated item is an audiocassette of remarks on Karales' life and works made by Sam Stephenson at the opening of an exhibit of Karales' work at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.</p>

	<p>Publications where Karales' works appeared include <title render="italic">Look</title>, <title render="italic">Life</title>, <title render="italic">Saturday Review</title>, <title render="italic">Pageant</title>, <title render="italic">Coronet</title>, <title render="italic">Popular Photography</title>, Time-Life books, and several encyclopedias.  A number of Karales' images from the U.S. civil rights movement achieved iconographic status, and were - and still are - widely reproduced.  The collection does not include Karales' photojournalistic work from East Germany (1970), or Gheel, Belgium (1961).  Karales also produced photographs for corporate annual reports. His work is represented in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. </p>

      <p>Formats in the collection include contact sheets, which serve as a thumbnail guide to most but not all of the prints and negatives in the collection; black-and-white proof prints and finished prints ranging from 8.5x14 to 16x20 inches; original negatives (closed to research use); and several hundred color slides.  Unless otherwise noted, the photographic items are arranged in the following sequence in each series: contact sheets, prints (from smallest to largest), slides, negatives, and finally, duplicates.</p>

      <p>Beginning with the contact sheets, researchers using the collection can note any identifying codes for the image, which may include Karales' job number (Karales assigned most of his jobs or photographic projects alpha-numeric codes), roll number, and frame (image) number, in that order.  Whenever possible, Rubenstein staff have included these numbers with individual prints and negatives and within the collection's inventory to aid in matching nd discovery.  In addition, staff have noted where film rolls are located within folders. For finished prints (typically 11x14 inches and larger), individual descriptions and unique Rubenstein library identifiers (beginning with "RL") have been assigned.  There are a few images that have no identifying numbers and could not otherwise be identified from contact sheets or negatives. Such captions appear in brackets.

          <p>These images are the results of Karales' first major photojournalistic work, a study of a small mining town in Ohio which was one of the first racially integrated towns in the U.S.  Subjects depicted include adults and children, houses, local stores, miners, street scenes, and social gathering places such as churches and dance halls.  Also includes images of Rendville's architecture, derelict buildings and landscape shots.  In 1958, Edward Steichen bought some of the Rendville pictures for the Museum of Modern Art and Helen Gee exhibited the photographs at the Limelight Gallery in Greenwich Village, marking this photographic work as a breakthrough for Karales.</p>

          <p>Series includes contact sheets, small work prints, large finished prints, and negatives (closed to use), all black-and-white. Prints are all marked on the back with the photographer's original identifier and whenever possible are arranged in that identifier order, that is, in chronological order.</p>

          <p>Black-and-white images taken by Karales early in his career for a Weyerhauser lumber company assignment portray a full range of activities associated with logging in Oregon in the 1950s.  Subjects feature individual loggers, logging crews and camp scenes, landscapes and aerial views of forested and logged areas, log driving, logging equipment, and logging activities on land and on a river.  Identified geographic locations include Oregon (where apparently most if not all the scenes were shot), and Mt. Hood.  The images are artistically compelling, featuring complex interplays of light and dark, and highlighting the placement of humans against natural landscapes and the giant trees they were felling.</p>
          <p>This series houses many "jobs" or photo shoots, to which Karales assigned an alpha or alphanumeric code.  Print numbers consist of this code, roll number, and frame number.  Prints are marked on the back with these original identifiers.</p>

          <p>The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was organized in 1960 at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Many (if not all) images were taken by Karales at a Passive Resistance Training in Atlanta, Georgia in 1960, for a <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine assignment.  Images capture African American men and women participating in group training sessions, simulating arguments and giving or receiving feigned physical abuse; in some images there are white people present.   The 20 large-format black-and-white prints are the only iamges in this series; there are no contact sheets or negatives.</p>

          <p>On assignment with <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine from 1963 to 1967, Karales travelled to South Vietnam twice to cover U.S. Special Forces units and their role during the Vietnam War.  Selected images from the thousands of frames shot by Karales were published in <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine, and were reproduced extensively for other  publications. All of the prints are in black-and-white, but there is a large group of over 1100 color slides.  There are also contact sheets and small work prints included in this series.</p>
          <p>Subjects in the images include: U.S. soldiers in Saigon, in combat, and at rest; daily interactions between American soldiers and Vietnamese civilians, including soldiers giving away candy, food, medical supplies, and other items; images of dead U.S. and Viet Cong; village scenes, including attacks on villages and subsequent relocation efforts; a Catholic chaplain's service; Vietnamese prison camps and hospitals; U.S. doctors in Vietnam; a Montagnard refugee camp; patrol scenes and other action in the field and on rivers; a delta rice and sugar cane factories, with workers in some images; schools and temples; and Saigon street scenes, often with U.S. soldiers buying goods or interacting with civilians.  There are images of prominent figures such as Sam Castan (reporter for <title render="italic">Look</title>, who worked closely with Karales and died in Vietnam), D. Halberstam, Ray Hernandon, and General Westmoreland.  There are also a few pictures of Karales.</p>
          <p>Some images bear titles assigned by Karales; titles in brackets supplied by library staff.  Prints are often stamped on the back with a year.  All prints are marked on back with the roll and frame number.  NOTE: titles on archival folders were taken from original envelopes, but often refer only to a subset of images in that folder; for example, a folder marked "Construction" may in fact contain only five or six images of construction projects, with the rest being street and combat scenes. </p>

          <p>Series of black-and-white images taken by Karales during three visits roughly ten years apart to New York City's Lower East Side neighborhoods.  The images, taken on assignment with <title render="italic">Look</title> magazine, feature street scenes and individual portraits of East Side residents, with subjects and settings including families, children, individuals, dogs, murals and graffiti, street games, drug abusers, a community clean-up of derelict building lots, and other social gatherings.  The Reverend <persname>Bruce Ritter</persname>, the founder of the <corpname>Covenant House</corpname> homeless youth shelter, is featured in many portraits and scenes.  A transcript of a lengthy interview with Father Ritter is also found in the Lower East Side Subseries of the Manuscripts and Printed Materials Series.  The images in the collection are not marked with corresponding travel dates; they are arranged in original order as received.</p>
