		<p>Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer was a progressive and activist rabbi who
		  expounded a politically engaged Conservative Judaism. For Meyer, religion was
		  inseparable from his politics, which spanned the breadth of local, national, and
		  international arenas.</p>
		<p>Meyer received his education from Dartmouth and the Jewish Theological
		  Seminary of America, where he came under the influence of Rabbi Abraham Joshua
		  Heschel. After being ordained rabbi in 1958, Meyer and his family moved to
		  Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1959, where they were to stay until 1984. During his
		  tenure as rabbi of Comunidad Bet El, Meyer led the reinvigoration and
		  renaissance of Argentina's Jewish community. He also lived and worked through
		  the political upheavals and turmoil of the 1970s and 1980s, openly speaking out
		  against the human rights abuses perpetrated under the rule of the military
		  junta, and visiting and attempting to secure the release of prisoners ("the
		  disappeared") in clandestine jails. Meyer was instrumental in negotiating the
		  release of Jacobo Timerman, who later dedicated his work, <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Prisoner Without a
		  Name, Cell Without a Number</title> to Meyer. After the return of democracy to
		  Argentina in 1983, Argentine President Raul Alfonsin recruited Meyer to serve
		  on CONADEP (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons), which led a
		  national investigation to establish the extent of the abuses suffered under the
		  military junta. </p>
		<p>Meyer returned to the United States in 1984 and took over the helm of
		  congregation B'nai Jeshurun, reviving the decaying New York City synagogue and
		  transforming it into a dynamic center for Judaism in the United
		  States. Meyer advocated for intra-religious dialogue and peace efforts, the
		  plight of marginalized groups within the United States, human rights abuses in
		  Central America (El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala), and for peace and
		  respect for human rights in Israel and Palestine.</p>

		<head>Collection Overview</head>
		<p>The papers of Marshall T. Meyer span the years 1919-2004. The collection contains personal and professional correspondence from throughout Meyer's career as a religious leader and human rights activist; his published and unpublished writings and speeches; printed material collected by Meyer;
Meyer's working and research files organized by geography, organizations, people, and subject; personal files, including appointment books, biographical material, papers from Meyer's school days, photographs, memorabilia, and material documenting his numerous engagements; audio tapes and cassettes of Meyer's services, interviews, lectures, and other events; and Betacam and VHS videocassette recordings of interviews and other public appearances by Meyer. </p>
		<p>The collection contains extensive evidence of Meyer's activities and interests, especially those he engaged in during his tenure at Comunidad Bet el in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and then at B'nai Jeshurun in New York City. The files document Meyer's professional activities, including his often over-lapping roles as religious leader, scholar, and human rights activist. Much of the material in the collection reflects Meyer's devotion and commitment to a socially and politically engaged Conservative Judaism and his involvement with Jewish communities around the world. Meyer was particularly involved in calling attention to human rights violations and working with the victims of violent political oppression in South and
Central America in the 1970s and 1980s and then in Palestine, Israel, and the Middle East in the 1990s. Meyer's extensive involvement and leadership in national and international religious, peace, and human rights organizations such as the World Council of Churches are also well-represented, as is his life-long association with his alma maters, Dartmouth College and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.</p>
		<p> The <ref linktype="simple" target="s1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence Series</ref> contains letters in English and Spanish written and received by Meyer (additional correspondence is also contained in Meyer's research files and electronic files). Significant correspondents include Louis Finkelstein, Abraham Joshua Heschel, and Shalom Spiegel.</p>
		<p> The <ref linktype="simple" target="s2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Writings and Speeches Series</ref> holds Meyer's original compositions in English, Spanish, and Hebrew. These compositions include various literary genres (op-eds, newspaper articles, essays) as well as speeches, addresses, and sermons.</p>
		<p> The <ref linktype="simple" target="s3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Research Files Series</ref> is subdivided into four categories: Geographic, Organizations, People, and Subject. These files may contain correspondence, notes, printed material, writings, and ephemera. The most common themes that run through this series include human rights, Jewish life, rabbinic education, Latin American Jewry, the Middle East, and Argentina's "Disappeared." The Research Files Series displays a deeper level of intellectual involvement by Meyer (e.g. annotations on printed material, categorizing and filing, integration of correspondence)</p>
		<p>The <ref linktype="simple" target="s4" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Printed Material Series</ref> includes newspapers, clippings, monographs, and serials that Meyer collected over the years. Subjects cover similar territory as the research files. Unlike the Research Files, this material is generally not annotated and was less organized.</p>
		<p>The <ref linktype="simple" target="s5" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Teaching Material Series</ref> contains material from classes taught by Meyer.</p>
		<p>The <ref linktype="simple" target="s6" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Personal Files Series</ref> includes material largely outside the scope of Meyer's professional work: photos, memorabilia, schoolwork, and appointment books. </p>
<p>Video and audio recordings of Meyer's engagements are found in the <ref linktype="simple" target="s7" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Audiovisual Material Series</ref>. These include lectures, speeches, interviews, television appearances, and religious services. Originals of video and audio tape are closed to use. Patrons must request use copies to access the content of the material. </p>
		<p>The <ref linktype="simple" target="s8" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Condolences Series</ref> contains cards and notes expressing sympathy on Meyer's death. Many of these contain testimonials and reminiscences of his role as rabbi and activist.</p>
		<p>Finally, the <ref linktype="simple" target="s9" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Electronic Files Series</ref> contains transcriptions of documents authored by or related to Meyer, many of which overlap with the content of and the <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Writings and Speeches, Teaching Material</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph> Series.</p>

				<p>Documents three types of oral addresses given by Meyer in English, Spanish, and Hebrew: first, speeches given by Meyer (these are often final drafts of addresses to various audiences: commencements, guest lectures, etc); second, transcripts of Meyer's classical
				  music radio show, which he conducted while attending Dartmouth College between
				  1946-48; third, sermon notes which are rough, handwritten notes Meyer appeared
				  to use while addressing more informal crowds, mainly religious in nature. Many
				  of these sermon notes are for religious services conducted during the Jewish
				  high holidays, and the majority are written in Hebrew. Speeches and sermon
				  notes written on small notecards have been removed from boxes 8-11 and placed
				  in smaller notecard boxes 12-13. Some related materials can be found in the <ref linktype="simple" target="s9" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Electronic Files Series.</ref></p>

Files contain articles, essays, correspondence, notes, mailings, and other sources of information regarding Judaism, Latin America, human rights, peace and anti-war activism, NGO's and other areas in which Meyer was heavily involved. Although the material goes as far back as 1902, the bulk of the material is from the mid 1980s to  the early 1990s.  Files from Meyer's offices in Buenos Aires (up to 1984) and New York City (1984-1993) are present. All subseries are arranged alphabetically by folder title.

In addition to many clippings from Meyer's CONADEP files, articles on Madres de Plaza de Mayo, the trials of Argentina's military rulers in the mid-1980s, and the Catholic Church are included. While some clippings come from non-Argentine sources, most articles are published by domestic publications. In particular, a substantial collection of issues of the Jewish newspaper <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Nueva Presencia</title>, dated between 1980 and 1987 can be found here. Issues of <title render="italic" linktype="simple">El Diario del Juicio</title> from 1985 complete the newspapers.
