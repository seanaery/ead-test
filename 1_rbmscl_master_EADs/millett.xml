      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Kate Millett span the years
        <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1912-2002</unitdate>, with the bulk of the
        papers dating between 1951 and 2001. The collection is arranged into the
        following series: Correspondence (CLOSED); Writings and Speeches; Subject
        Files; Art Files ; Farm Papers; Course Materials ; Personal Files; Documentary
        Film:
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Three Lives</title> (1970); Clippings; Audiovisual
      Materials; Photographic Materials; Ephemera; and Printed Materials. The
      collection provides rich documentation of Millett's activities as a feminist
      activist, artist, and author of numerous works, including
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sexual Politics</title>, whose publication
      established her as one of the founding 20th century feminists. Other works for
      which supporting materials exist are
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Loony-bin Trip</title>,
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Flying</title>, and
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Basement</title>. </p>
      <p>The collection reflects the intensely personal nature of much of
        Millett's work and the frequent fusion of her personal, political, and
        professional interests. There are many files of personal and literary
        correspondence, including significant exchanges with
        <persname>Ti-Grace Atkinson</persname>,
        <persname>Rita Mae Brown</persname>,
        <persname>Phyllis Chesler</persname>,
        <persname>Andrea Dworkin</persname>,
        <persname>Cynthia McAdams</persname>,
        <persname>Yoko Ono</persname>,
        <persname>Alix Kates Shulman</persname>, and
        <persname>Gloria Steinem</persname>, and many other activists, writers,
        artists, friends, lovers, and family. Additional series include writings by
        other authors; extensive topical files; materials documenting Millett's work as
        an artist; files relating to her New York farm and artists' colony; course
        materials from Millett's student and teaching careers; and scripts and other
        papers relating to Millett's little-known
        <subject>documentary film,</subject>
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Three Lives</title>. Other materials document her
      relationship with her mother during the last years of her mother's life, also
      the topic of her book,
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Mother Millett</title>. Subject files contain
      materials relating to Millett's involvement with the
      <subject>gay and lesbian communities</subject>, her research on
      <subject>prisons</subject> and
      <subject>torture</subject>, and her diagnosis with
      <subject>bipolar disorder</subject> and subsequent involvement in
      <subject>anti-psychiatry</subject> activism. Audiovisual materials
      include
      <genreform>audio</genreform> and
      <genreform>video</genreform> recordings of Millett's lectures, speeches,
      and many conversations with activists, friends, and family; many
      <genreform>photographs</genreform> round out the visual components of the
      collection. There are also extensive printed materials such as clippings,
      <genreform>posters</genreform>,
      <genreform>newsletters</genreform>, and
      <genreform>serial publications</genreform>.</p>
      <p>Seen in a broader context, Millett's papers also provide important
        documentation of the history of the
        <subject>feminist movement</subject> and
        <subject>feminist theory</subject> in the United States, including the
        history of the
        <corpname>National Organization for Women</corpname>. Materials in the
        collection also cover
        <subject>feminism</subject> and the social conditions for women around
        the globe, especially in
        <geogname>France</geogname>,
        <geogname>Italy</geogname>, and the Middle East -- most notably
        <geogname>Iran</geogname>, where Millett traveled in the seventies.</p>

      <p>The collection includes some correspondence, book drafts, and other
        writings in electronic form. Documents in electronic formats are included in
        the container list under the appropriate series. The electronic files are
        located on the electronic records server. Consult a reference archivist for
        access to them.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> is CLOSED to
        research until the year 2020.</p>
      <p>Drafts and other materials relating to Millett's published works are
        housed in eponymous subseries in the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches
        Series </emph>. Other subseries include Interviews, Speeches, Engagements, and
        Writings by Others. The extensive correspondence in this series relating to
        Millett's public appearances suggests the importance of this aspect of her
        professional life, while the many folders of correspondence from fans document
        the impact that Millett's writings had on many of her readers' lives.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series </emph> is arranged into
        the following subseries:
        <subject>Prisons</subject>,
        <subject>Psychiatric Survivors Movement</subject>,
        <subject>Torture</subject>,
        <subject>Travel</subject>,
        <corpname>Women's Archives Project</corpname>,
        <subject>Women's Rights Movement</subject>,and General Subject Files.
        It primarily consists of materials collected and arranged by Millett that
        document her political activities as a feminist,
        <subject>mental health</subject> reformer, and social activist;
        information that Millett gathered for her writings and other projects; and
        personal papers related to travel, funding for her farm, and other issues.
        There are detailed records dating from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s of
        Millett's involvement in the
        <corpname>National Organization for Women</corpname> and other feminist
        groups, first in
        <geogname>New York</geogname> and later in
        <geogname>California</geogname>. Local and national self-advocacy
        organizations for those diagnosed with
        <subject>mental illness</subject> are also well-represented for the
        period from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. </p>
      <p>Millett's career as a sculptor and artist is documented in the
        <emph render="bold">Art Files Series </emph>, which houses correspondence,
        <subject>art</subject> show announcements, financial records, and other
        materials. There is substantial documentation of Millett's involvement in the
        cooperative
        <corpname>Noho Gallery</corpname> and her sales of posters and silk
        screens through advertising in
        <subject>feminist publications</subject>. There is a small amount of
        material related to Millett's involvement in the
        <corpname>Fluxus</corpname> art movement, which emerged in New York
        during the 1960s and spread to Europe and then Japan (Yoko Ono was one of its
        proponents).</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Farm Papers Series </emph> includes
        correspondence and administrative records from Millett's farm in
        <geogname>Poughkeepsie, New York</geogname>. The farm is run as a
        women's cooperative and artists' colony, with writers and artists applying for
        residency and working on the farm. The Correspondence Subseries provides a
        portrait of Millett's relationships with former farm residents, and includes
        application materials for prospective residents. The Administrative Files
        Subseries include some materials on the farm's financial difficulties, as well
        as a variety of records related to the day-to-day operation of the farm and its
        Christmas tree operation.</p>
      <p>Class notes, papers, and records from Millett's work as a student and
        as a professor are found in the <emph render="bold">Course Materials Series
        </emph>. The bulk of the series consists of reading notes, lecture notes, and
        student papers by Millett and her students. Records of Millett's student work
        are primarily from the
        <corpname>University of Minnesota</corpname> and
        <corpname>Oxford University</corpname>. Her most well-documented
        teaching positions were at
        <corpname>Barnard College</corpname> and the
        <corpname>California State University at Sacramento</corpname>. In
        addition to class records, the series contains some correspondence and
        university-related records documenting Millett's life as a student and her
        activities as a professor. The course materials from Millett's graduate work
        and teaching positions in the 1960s and 1970s provide evidence of her
        increasing feminist involvement and insight into the evolution of her work,
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sexual Politics</title>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series</emph> is arranged into
        a number of subseries. The most substantial of these is the Loft Papers, which
        houses records related to Millett's artist's loft in the
        <geogname>Cooper Square</geogname> area of
        <geogname>New York City</geogname>. These records document her
        involvement in neighborhood groups and artists' organizations working to
        protect the area from development, and provide an excellent view of
        <geogname>New York City</geogname> neighborhood activism on development
        issues. There are smaller groups of records related to Millett's financial,
        legal, and medical affairs, and some personal papers of Millett's mother
        <persname>Helen Millett</persname>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Documentary Film:
        <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Three Lives</title> Series</emph> contains
        records of a
        <subject>documentary film</subject> produced by Millett and featuring
        Millett's sister
        <persname>Mallory Millett-Jones</persname>,
        <persname>Lillian Shreve</persname>, and
        <persname>Robin Mide</persname>. The film led to a lawsuit over the
        distribution of profits among the various women involved. The series consists
        of production materials, distribution and financial records, and some legal
        correspondence. A viewing copy of the film is not currently available in this
        collection.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> chiefly consists of
        articles covering Millett's 1979 visit to and expulsion from
        <geogname>Iran</geogname>, and provides insights into Iranian
        <subject>feminism</subject> and the Iranian political situation during
        that period. Sources include the American, French, and (to a lesser extent)
        Persian-language media. A second focus of the series is media coverage of
        Millett's activities and projects, especially during the 1970s. Other clippings
        are related to Millett's wide-ranging personal and professional interests,
        especially prison reform and the status of women around the world. The series
        also includes a number of grassroots publications and newsletters.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series
        </emph> consists of audio recordings of Millett's public appearances and of
        private conversations and social events involving Millett. The years 1979 and
        1980 are particularly well represented. Millett made recordings almost daily
        during and after her 1979 visit to
        <geogname>Iran</geogname> and during the late summer of 1980. There are
        also audio recordings of Millett's mother and other family members, oral
        interviews for Millett's research on
        <subject>torture</subject>, and dictated drafts of
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">A.D.</title> and
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Loony-bin Trip</title>. Other materials in
      this series include videotapes of interviews and television shows, and of
      several New York City functions for which Millett was a reader or speaker. Some
      materials in this series may not be immediately available, as use copies may
      need to be made of original recordings. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph> consist
        primarily of photographs taken by others and sent to Millett. The professional
        photographers among Millett's acquaintance, including
        <persname>Cynthia MacAdams</persname> and
        <persname>Jill Krementz</persname>, took a number of portraits of
        Millett. Photographs most likely taken by Millett include a large number of
        slides dating from 1980, documenting the same time period as many of the
        audiotapes in the Audiovisual Materials Series. There are a limited number of
        photographs from Millett's childhood and early adulthood. </p>
      <p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph>
        consists of magazines and journals, newspapers, and a small number of books
        collected by Millett. Many periodicals contain articles by or about Millett.
        The series includes scattered issues of various local and ephemeral periodicals
        from the feminist movement, the
        <subject>lesbian</subject> community, and the
        <subject>psychiatric survivors movement</subject>. Printed materials
        can also be found scattered throughout the collection, particularly in the
        <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> and <emph render="bold">Clippings
        Series</emph>. In order to provide better housing, an extensive group of
        printed materials, chiefly books by feminists, has been separated from the Kate
        Millett Papers and housed with the Rare Books, Manuscript and Special
        Collections Library's rare materials. Please consult with the reference
        librarians to see the title list.</p>
      <p>The papers of Kate Millett arrived together with a collection of over
        270 pieces of Millett's artwork. Most of the pieces consist of ink drawings,
        calligraphy, and prints. There are also sculptures and other three-dimensional
        works, some of which formed part of an installation representing events that
        surrounded the murder of Sylvia Likens, also the subject of Millett's book,
      <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Basement</title>. A full inventory of the
      artwork is located in the Research Room of the library; please contact the
      Research Services staff. Some artwork is included in this finding aid in the Oversize Materials series.</p>

          <p>Contains drafts, notes, correspondence, and other materials
            related to Millett's books, speeches, interviews, and minor writings.
            Manuscripts of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry by other authors can be found
            in the Writings by Others Subseries at the end of the series, arranged by
            author name.</p>
          <p> Materials on
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sexual Politics</title>,
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Flying</title>,
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sita</title>,

          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Politics of Cruelty</title>, and
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Mother Millett</title> are located in
          individual subseries. Less extensive material on Millett's other published
          books can be found at the beginning of the Other Writings Subseries. For each
          published book, undated drafts and notes are placed first, followed by book
          reviews, fan mail, contracts, and material collected by Millett as background
          for the book. Book drafts are sometimes labeled by letter, as in "draft A" or
          "draft B." This does not imply that one was written before the other, but only
          gives an order to their presentation.</p>
          <p> The Other Writings Subseries also includes material on Millett's
            articles and unpublished manuscripts. The Interviews Subseries contains
            correspondence, clippings, and a small number of transcripts of interviews with
            Millett. The Speeches Subseries includes Millett's speech notes and drafts,
            along with related records, while the Engagements Subseries primarily consists
            of correspondence about speaking engagements and material from conferences in
            which Millett participated. These subseries are in chronological order.</p>
          <p> The series includes some documents in
            <genreform>electronic format</genreform>. In general, electronic
            documents are grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there
            is no corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only."
            Electronic versions of book drafts are in chronological order together with
            other dated material. For each electronic document, the container list provides
            the file name, the date the file was last modified, and the number assigned to
            the original computer disk on which the file was received. Consult a reference
            archivist for access to electronic documents.</p>
          <p> Millett's own folder labels have been retained when possible.
            Additional correspondence from readers, correspondence with publishers and
            Millett's agent, and correspondence regarding articles and speeches by Millett
            can be found in the Correspondence Series. Research material for
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Going to Iran</title> and additional book
          reviews, especially for
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sexual Politics</title>, are located in the
          Clippings Series. The Printed Material Series includes additional reviews,
          interviews, and articles by Millett. Audio recordings for drafts of
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Loony-bin Trip</title> and
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">A.D.</title> are located in the Audiovisual
          Material Series. The Audiovisual Series also includes recordings of Millett's
          speeches, readings, and interviews.</p>

          <p>The Subject Files primarily include records from Millett's
            political involvements as a feminist, a
            <subject>mental health</subject> reformer, and a social activist;
            information that Millett collected for her writings and other projects; and
            personal papers related to
            <subject>travel</subject>, funding for the farm, and other issues.
            The early
            <subject>women's rights movement</subject>, from the late 1960s to
            the mid-1970s, is strongly represented. Various
            <subject>self-advocacy</subject> organizations within the
            <subject>psychiatric survivors movement</subject>, primarily from
            the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, are also well-represented. The series includes
            the following subseries:
            <subject>Prisons</subject>,
            <subject>Psychiatric Survivors Movement</subject>,
            <subject>Torture</subject>,
            <subject>Travel</subject>, Women's Archives Project, and
            <subject>Women's Rights Movement</subject>. Within each subseries,
            files are organized in alphabetical order. General subject files are placed at
            the end of the series in alphabetical order. Millett's own folder titles have
            been retained where possible.</p>
          <p> The series includes some documents in
            <genreform>electronic format</genreform>. Electronic documents are
            grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no
            corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For
            each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was
            last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which
            the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic
            documents.</p>

          <p>The Art Files Series contains correspondence, art show
            announcements, financial records, and other materials related to Millett's work
            as a sculptor and artist. Included also are some materials on other artists'
            work. Millett's activities as a member of the cooperative
            <corpname>Noho Gallery</corpname> are documented, and there are
            some materials from her involvement in the
            <corpname>Fluxus</corpname> movement. There are detailed records of
            Millett's direct sales of posters and silk screens, including fan letters from
            individuals who saw Millett's posters advertised in
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Ms.</title> magazine and other women's media
          outlets. Files in this series have not been arranged.</p>
          <p> The series includes some documents in
            <genreform>electronic format</genreform>. Electronic documents are
            grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no
            corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For
            each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was
            last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which
            the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic
            documents.</p>
          <p> See the Subject Files for additional material on other artists'
            shows and on Millett's poster sales. </p>

          <p>The Farm is a
            <subject>women's art colony</subject> and
            <subject>farm collective</subject> in
            <geogname>Poughkeepsie, New York</geogname>, founded and operated
            by Kate Millett. The series is divided into correspondence and administrative
            files. The correspondence consists chiefly of letters from friends and former
            students of Millett, and applications for residency. It is arranged
            chronologically, with application materials, including writing samples and
            artwork from prospective residents, placed at the end of the Correspondence
            Subseries. Administrative files are arranged chronologically at the end of the
            series. The administrative files consist of business records, plus a wide
            variety of other material related to the operation of the farm. This includes
            correspondence with past residents who volunteered to help with farmwork,
            publicity material on the farm and its Christmas tree sales, and Millett's
            personal account of the difficulties of running the farm in the early 1990s.
            Additional material on efforts to raise funds in the early 1990s can be found
            in the Women's Archives Project Subseries of the Subject Files.</p>
          <p> The series includes some documents in
            <genreform>electronic format</genreform>. Electronic documents are
            grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no
            corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For
            each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was
            last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which
            the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic
            documents.</p>

          <p>The bulk of this series consists of reading notes and lecture
            notes from Millett's work as a student and as a professor. The series also
            contains Millett's student papers, papers written by her own students, and
            correspondence and other material related to her university activities.
            Millett's undergraduate work at the
            <corpname>University of Minnesota</corpname> and
            <corpname>Oxford University</corpname> is well represented, and
            some material is available from Millett's graduate work at
            <corpname>Columbia University</corpname>. Teaching materials are
            primarily from Millett's work at
            <corpname>Barnard College</corpname> and
            <corpname>California State University at Sacramento</corpname>.
            </p>
          <p> The series is divided into two subseries for Millett's student
            work and teaching materials, and is in chronological order within each
            subseries. However, it is sometimes unclear whether notes from the 1960s
            represent student or teaching work, since Millett both taught and completed her
            graduate work during this period.</p>
          <p> The series includes some documents in
            <genreform>electronic format</genreform>. Electronic documents are

            records. The bulk of the series consists of financial records, records of Helen

          <p> The series includes some documents in

            grouped with folders containing related paper documents. If there is no
            corresponding folder, the documents are marked "electronic format only." For
            each document, the container list provides the file name, the date the file was
            last modified, and the number assigned to the original computer disk on which
            the file was received. Consult a reference archivist for access to electronic
            documents.</p>

          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Three Lives</title> was a
          <subject>documentary film</subject> produced by Millett and featuring
          Millett's sister
          <persname>Mallory Millett-Jones</persname>,
          <persname>Lillian Shreve</persname>, and
          <persname>Robin Mide</persname>. The film led to a lawsuit over the
          distribution of profits among the various women involved. The series consists
          of production material, distribution and financial records, and some legal
          correspondence. Undated production material are placed first, followed by other
          records in chronological order. A 16mm audio recording from the film production
          is located in the Audiovisual Materials Series. A viewing copy of the film is
          not currently available.</p>

          <p>Newspaper and magazine clippings covering Millett's 1979 visit to
            and expulsion from
            <geogname>Iran</geogname>, Iranian
            <subject>feminism</subject>, and the Iranian political situation
            during that period. A wide spectrum of American, French, and (to a lesser
            extent) Persian-language media is included. A second focus of the series is
            media coverage of Millett's activities and projects, especially for the 1970s.
            Other clippings are related to Millett's wide-ranging personal and professional
            interests, particularly prison reform and the status of women's rights around
            the world. A small amount of correspondence and other material is intermixed
            with the clippings. There are also a number of full issues of activist
            publications and newsletters.</p>
          <p>In most cases, files in this series are arranged in original
            order, and have been left undated unless Millett's original folder title
            included a date range. There are few clippings from the 1980s. The series is in
            alphabetical order.
            <geogname>Iran</geogname> clippings are placed last, and are
            unorganized. Substantial numbers of clippings can be also found in the Subject
            Files and the Writings and Speeches Series.</p>

          <p>The bulk of the series consists of
            <genreform>audio recordings</genreform>, chiefly on audiocassette,
            of Millett's public appearances, lectures, and interviews, and audio recordings
            of private conversations and social events involving Millett. The years 1979
            and 1980 are particularly well represented. Millett made recordings almost
            daily during and after her 1979 visit to
            <geogname>Iran</geogname> and during the late summer of 1980. There
            are also audio recordings of Millett's mother and other family members, oral
            interviews for Millett's research on
            <subject>torture</subject>, and dictated drafts of
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">A.D.</title> and
          <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Loony-Bin Trip</title>. Early video
          recordings include lectures by Millett and Millett's readings of
          <persname>Anas Nin</persname>. </p>
          <p> The series is divided into subseries by format: audiocassettes,
            mixed materials, phonograph records, audiotapes (reels), and video recordings.
            The Mixed Material Subseries consists of several different formats, chiefly
            audio cassette, accompanied by substantial amounts of written material.
            Audiocassette tapes are grouped by subject and organized chronologically within
            each subject where feasible. Other materials generally have been left in
            original order. Millett's titles have been retained throughout the series.</p>

            <p>Consists of VHS videocassettes and open reel videotapes. VHS
              tapes contain interviews and lectures given by Millett. There are two series of
              recordings on open reel videotape, both dating from the mid to late 1970s. The
              first series shows a 1976 reading at the Woman's Salon, a feminist literary
              salon in New York City. Millett and other writers speak about Anas Nin and read
              Nin's works. The second group of open reel recordings were made by
              <persname>Alida Walsh</persname> and
              <persname>Janey Washburn</persname> as a gift for Millett. They
              show the opening reception of a Millett art show, most likely at the Chuck
              Levitan Gallery in New York City. The recordings are unedited, with random
              crowd scenes mixed with informal interviews with guests.
              <persname>Cynthia MacAdams</persname> is mentioned as the model
              for the artwork, and makes frequent appearances in the recordings.</p>

            <genreform>negatives</genreform>. There are portraits of Millett
            from a variety of sources. The professional photographers among Millett's
            acquaintance, including
            <persname>Cynthia MacAdams</persname> and
            <persname>Jill Krementz</persname>, took a number of photographs of
            Millett. Photographs most likely taken by Millett include a large number of
            slides dating from 1980, documenting the same time period as many of the
            audiotapes in the Audiovisual Materials Series. There are a limited number of
            snapshots from Millett's childhood and early adulthood. </p>
          <p> Some photographs have been removed from correspondence located in
            other series. In these cases, the original series is identified and as much
            information as is available is given about the matching correspondence. The
