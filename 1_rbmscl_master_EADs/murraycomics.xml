        1970s. Terry, a science fiction expert, is the author of <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Science Fiction Magazine Story Index, 1926-1995</title> (McFarland, 1999).

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Murray comic collection is notable for its size, depth, and comprehensive holdings of
        Marvel and DC comics from the mid-1960s to 2001. Most major American genres are represented,
        including superhero, crime, sci-fi, western, romance, funny animal, biography, humor, war,
        and horror. Some promotional comics are included, along with a selection of underground
        comics from the late 1960s through the 1980s. The earliest issues in the collection date
        from the late 1930s, and about one-third of the issues dates from before 1970. In addition
        to Marvel and DC, other publishers substantially represented in the collection include:
        Atlas, Charlton, Dark Horse, Dell, Disney, Eclipse, First, Gladstone, Gold Key, Image,
        Malibu, Quality, Valiant, and WaRP Graphics. The comic books are a separately cataloged and
        housed subcollection of the Edwin and Terry Murray Collection of Pulp Culture.</p>
      <p>The collection has been organized into five series. The first three series of
        regular-format comics are arranged by publisher: <emph render="bold">DC</emph>,<emph
          render="bold">Marvel</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Assorted Small Publishers</emph>.
        Within the <emph render="bold">DC</emph> and <emph render="bold">Marvel</emph> series,
        issues are alphabetized by indicia title within each box. The indicia, or small print
        usually found at the bottom of the first page or the inside front cover, are the publisher's
        official identifying information. The <emph render="bold">Assorted Small Publishers</emph>
        series is organized by publisher, then indicia title. The <emph render="bold"
          >Underground</emph> comics, including various size formats, have been organized separately
        (by publisher, then indicia title) into a fourth series. The fifth series contains <emph
          render="bold">Oversize</emph> or large-format comics, arranged by publisher, then indicia
        title. Cover titles are listed only when they differ from the indicia title, or when there
        are multiple cover titles under one indicia title housed in the same box. Box numbers are
        not always sequential; some numbers in the sequence have been skipped. Two supplementary
        container lists provide greater intellectual access by rearranging the numbered boxes into
        lists by title (arranged alphabetically) and decade of publication.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">DC</emph> series, dating from the 1930s to 2002, contains
        near-complete runs of <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Action Comics</title>, <title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Adventure Comics</title>,<title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Detective Comics</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic"
          >Batman</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Superman</title>, <title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Flash</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic"
          >Green Lantern</title>,<title linktype="simple" render="italic">Wonder Woman</title>,
          <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Superboy</title>, <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Supergirl</title>, and <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Sgt.
          Rock</title>. The collection also includes a large number of war comics, western comics,
        science fiction comics, horror comics, and some romance comics. Modern writers such as Alan
        Moore, Frank Miller, and Neil Gaiman are also heavily represented. Nearly every DC comic
        published from the 1970s onward is part of the collection, including the bulk of comics that
        appeared under the Vertigo imprint.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Marvel</emph> series, dating from the 1940s to 2002, contains
        near-complete runs of <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Avengers</title>,<title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Captain America</title>, <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Fantastic Four</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic"
          >Daredevil</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Incredible Hulk</title>,
          <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Punisher</title>, <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Spider-Man</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Thor</title>,
          and<title linktype="simple" render="italic">X-Men</title>. Some <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Captain Marvel</title> titles are included in this series; other <title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Captain Marvel</title>issues and early Marvel titles
        (under Atlas publications) can be found in the <emph render="bold">Assorted Small
          Publishers</emph> series. First issues include<title linktype="simple" render="italic"
          >Amazing Fantasy Introducing Spider-Man</title> and <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Incredible Hulk</title>. Early titles in the <emph render="bold"
          >Marvel</emph> series include the western comics <title linktype="simple" render="italic"
          >Kid Colt Outlaw</title> and <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Two-Gun Kid</title>.
        Science fiction, war comics, and horror comics are also part of the series. Other titles of
        note include <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Black Panther</title>, one of the
        first black superheroes, and <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Northstar</title>, the
        first mainstream openly gay superhero. The work of writer/editor Stan Lee and artist Jack
        Kirby, considered by many to have transformed the comics industry in the 1960s and 1970s, is
        well represented here. Other writers and artists include Todd McFarlane, Rob Liefeld, and
        Jim Lee, who eventually left Marvel to form Image (Image publications are included in the
          <emph render="bold">Assorted Small Publishers</emph> series).</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Assorted Small Publishers</emph> series, dating from the 1930s to
        the early 2000s, represents nearly one-hundred seventy publishers. Significant or
        substantial holdings include works published by Adventure; Archie; Atlas; Charlton; Comico;
        Dark Horse; Dell; Disney; Eclipse; Epic, an imprint of Marvel; Fawcett; First; Gilberton;
        Gladstone; Gold Key; Image; Kitchen Sink; Lev Gleason; Malibu; promotional comics by Buster
        Brown and Will Eisner; Quality; Timely; Topps; WaRP; and Valiant. The earliest published
        titles in this series, all from the 1930s, are Dell's <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Dick Tracy</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Moon
          Mullins</title>,<title linktype="simple" render="italic">Terry and the Pirates</title>,
          and<title linktype="simple" render="italic">Wash Tubbs</title>. Other notable early
        publications dating from the 1940s are <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Amazing
          Comics</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Archie Comics</title>, <title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Captain Marvel</title>,<title linktype="simple"

          linktype="simple" render="italic">Red Dragon Comics</title>, <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Sub-Mariner Comics</title>, and Walt Disney and Warner Bros.
        adaptations.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Underground Comics</emph> series dates from the 1960s to the 1980s,
        with the bulk published during the 1970s. Publishers substantially represented include Apex
        Novelties, Krupps Comic Works (publisher of Kitchen Sink Enterprises), Last Gasp, Rip Off
        Press, and Print Mint. The representative sampling of comics in this series is considered
        "underground" because of their unconventional storylines and explicit content. Published
        largely in San Francisco, underground comics frequently satirized "hippie" life in the '70s.
        This series includes the titles <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Death
          Rattle</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Despair</title>, <title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers</title>, <title
          linktype="simple" render="italic">Jesus Comics</title>, <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Mr. Natural</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">R. Crumb's
          Comics and Stories</title>, <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Slow Death</title>,
          <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Skull</title>, and <title linktype="simple"
          render="italic">Zap Comix</title>. The work of prominent artists/writers R. Crumb, Gilbert
        Shelton, and Frank Stack (aka Foolbert Sturgeon) is heavily represented. Also included is
          <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Snarf</title> (no. 3) with cover by guest
        illustrator, Will Eisner.</p>
      <p>The fifth series comprises <emph render="bold">Oversize</emph> or large-format comics and
        graphic novels from a variety of publishers, housed separately due to their size. Publishers
        include DC, Marvel, Dark Horse, Epic, Gladstone, and WaRP Graphics.</p>
      <p>This collection also includes unprocessed additions, Acc. 2010-0071 and 2010-0107. Boxlists
        for these comics have been added to the end of this finding aid. </p>
