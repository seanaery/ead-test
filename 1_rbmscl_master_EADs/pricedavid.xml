		<abstract encodinganalog="520">The David Price Papers (1960-2006)
		  document the scholarly and political career of David Eugene Price, including
		  his days as a graduate student in the 1960s, his tenure as a political science
		  professor and Democratic Party staff member, and, finally, his years as a
		  Democratic congressman from North Carolina's Fourth District. Records from
		  Price's political headquarters contain thousands of original documents,
		  handwritten and computer-generated; printed materials such as legislative bills
		  and campaign publicity; and a variety of audiovisual materials, including
		  photographs, some slides, many videos, and audio recordings. The collection is
		  especially rich for researchers interested in the American political party
		  system, the work and life of legislators, North Carolina history and
		  government, the North Carolina Democratic and Republican parties, the U.S.
		  Congress, its committee structure, the Hunt Commission, and the broader
		  legislative process. Other materials document political campaigns, notably
		  David Price's own congressional campaigns and Albert Gore's senatorial campaign
		  of 1970-1971.</abstract>

		<head>Collection Overview</head>
		<p>The <emph render="bold">David Price Papers</emph> document the scholarly and
		  political career of David Eugene Price, including his days as a graduate
		  student in the 1960s, his tenure as a political science professor and

		  <subject>Democratic Party</subject> staff member, and, finally, his years as a Democratic
		  congressman from North Carolina's Fourth District from 1987 through 1998.
		  Records from Price's political headquarters record the routine activities of
		  Price and his office staff, and the larger system of government in which he
		  participated. The files contain documents, handwritten and computer-generated;
		  printed materials such as
		  <subject>legislative bills</subject> and
		  <subject>campaign publicity</subject>; and a
		  variety of audiovisual materials, including photographs, some slides, many
		  videos, and audio recordings. The collection is especially rich for researchers
		  interested in the
		  <subject>American political party system</subject>, the work and life of
		  legislators,
		  <subject>North Carolina history and government</subject>, the North Carolina
		  Democratic and Republican Parties, the
		  <subject>U.S. Congress</subject>, its committee structure,
		  the
		  <subject>Hunt Commission</subject>, and especially the larger
		  <subject>legislative process</subject>. Other
		  topics include
		  <subject>political campaigns</subject>, notably Price's own
		  <subject>campaigns</subject> and Albert
		  Gore's senatorial campaign of 1970-1971.</p>
		<p>Three primary groups comprise the collection. Full descriptions
		  of series and subseries within these groups are found below in the
		  detailed collection description. The <emph render="bold">Pre-Congressional
		  Papers</emph> primarily document Price's years as a student, then as a
		  professor at
		  <corpname>Yale</corpname> and
		  <corpname>Duke</corpname> Universities; they also trace Price's early
		  involvement with the Democratic Party. These papers are a foundation and
		  prelude to Price's later work as a member of Congress. The <emph render="bold">Congressional Papers</emph> were compiled during his years in
		  public office, and reveal Price's activities as a member of Congress, and his
		  relationships with colleagues, constituents, and other political stakeholders.
		  Finally, the <emph render="bold">Campaign Office Files</emph> were created from
		  the activity of his campaign office in Raleigh, North Carolina, largely
		  separate - as required by law - from the work of his congressional office. </p></scopecontent>

		  <p>Most original folders and folder titles have been retained. Labels included many abbreviations, acronyms, and initials; the full versions were added in brackets whenever possible. "DP" in folder titles and
			 elsewhere usually refers to "David Price" but can also mean "Democratic Party."
			 Keyword searching is possible within the container list, with some important
			 limitations. First, the expanded forms of acronyms and abbreviations were not
			 added in every instance but rather at the first occurrence with a new series or
			 subseries. Second, labels are not standardized. For example, the search "breast
			 cancer" might retrieve some folders, but not the one labeled "Cancer--breast."
			 A search for the EPA's "Southern Appalachian Mountains Air Quality Initiative"
			 within this collection may not retrieve folders labeled only as "Southern
			 Appalachian Air Quality." To be comprehensive, therefore, searches need to be
			 formulated in several ways. Please consult with a Research Services staff when
			 using this collection.</p>
		  <p>Dates were obtained by sampling within folders and so may not be
			 strictly accurate. Sampling was also used to identify the content of
			 audiovisual materials, therefore descriptions for recordings may not be
			 complete.</p>

			 <p>These files document the bulk of David Price's academic career
				prior to his entry into elective office, and reveal the formation of Price's
				intellectual interest in politics and political parties. Beginning in the
				mid-1960s during his time as a graduate student at Yale University, they
				continue through his years on the faculties of Yale and Duke, and end in 1988
				during his first term in Congress. The materials are divided into three series,

				<p>Documents Price's close observance of, employment with, and
				  research on the
				  <subject>Republican and Democratic political parties,</subject>
				  from his graduate work at Yale up to the time he was first elected to Congress.
				  During much of this period Price was serving as a professor of political
				  science at Yale and Duke Universities. Concurrently he also worked for the
				  <corpname>North Carolina State Democratic Party</corpname> in
				  various capacities, serving as executive director and as state party chair, and
				  for the national party as director of the
				  <subject>Hunt Commission (Commission on Presidential
					 Nominations)</subject>. The files illustrate the inter-relationship of Price's
				  political work and research. Many of the topical folders contain Price's notes,
				  often related to his writings, as well as articles and documents written by
				  others. Background files for his book on American political parties,
				<title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bringing Back the Parties</title>, can be
				found in this series. As in other parts of the collection, Price's
				relationships with other prominent political figures are documented here,
				especially with
				<persname>Jim Hunt</persname>, North Carolina governor and head of
				the
				<corpname>Hunt Commission</corpname>. Correspondence, Hunt
				Commission documents and meeting transcripts, and a file on Jim Hunt's Senate
				race against Jesse Helms are included. Other files relate to talks Price gave
				as a state party leader and include the speeches themselves or Price's notes.
				There are also files on conferences attended, polling information, and numerous
				files on
				<subject>Democratic campaigns</subject> such as Hunt-Helms (U.S.
				Senate, 1984), Muskie (U.S. Presidency, 1972), Carter (U.S. Presidency, 1980),
				and
				<persname>Albert Gore, Sr.</persname> (U.S. Senate, 1970). </p>
				<p>The files are arranged roughly in alphabetical order by title.
				  </p>
				<p>See also the Research and Writings Series for further
				  documentation of Price's research interests.</p>

				<p>Documents various aspects of Price's political and academic
				  careers. Political files illuminate Price's ties to other prominent Democrats
				  and his work on the Democratic Party's behalf, chiefly through correspondence,
				  while academic files concern Price's academic administrative responsibilities,
				  chiefly at Duke University and less often at Yale University; some materials
				  pertain to personal activities such as Price's leave of absence, including
				  fellowship applications, course syllabi, and course evaluations. Other items,
				  such as departmental newsletters and other materials, give a larger picture of
				  Price's academic environment. One file relates to the controversy over whether
				  Duke should host the
				  <corpname>Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library</corpname>. While
				  correspondence is scattered throughout the Pre-Congressional Papers, this
				  series contains several folders devoted almost entirely to correspondence.
				  These letters to and from Price cover both personal and political topics, with
				  the latter most often about fundraising.</p>
				<p>The series is roughly arranged alphabetically by topic.</p>

				<p>These materials, dating from the time of Price's dissertation
				  research up to his first election in 1987, document his career-long interest
				  and extensive scholarship in politics and the
				  <subject>legislative process.</subject> While similar to the
				  Political Party Files in that both contain research, these files focus less on
				  Price's work for the Democratic Party or his academic work on the subject of
				  political parties. Topics instead relate more to his scholarship in other areas
				  of government and
				  <subject>legislative policy.</subject></p>
				<p>While there is no draft of Price's dissertation within the
				  collection, a number of files pertain to that research, including notes from
				  many
				  <genreform>Senate interviews.</genreform> Often the folders are
				  topically centered on various
				  <subject>congressional committees</subject> or particular
				  <subject>policy areas</subject> (e.g. oceanography). Articles by
				  others accompanied by Price's notes and pertinent correspondence may be found
				  in this subseries also. As in previous subseries, correspondence is scattered
				  throughout. These are the types of files presumably created as
				  <genreform>research files</genreform> to assist Price in his own
				  writing. In fact, there are more research materials than there are actual
				  writings by Price himself. Document types include numerous
				  <genreform>handwritten notes,</genreform> some
				  <genreform>article drafts,</genreform> writings by others, and
				  printed materials such as clippings, and parts of the

				<scopecontent>
				  <p>Correspondence sent to and from Congressman Price documenting
					 interactions with constituents; corporations and other organizations;
					 government colleagues, especially other House Members; government agencies;
					 national associations and organizations; and various notable political figures
					 including U.S. presidents and foreign dignitaries. Notable correspondents
					 include many
					 <subject>House Members</subject> and Senators including Speaker

					 <persname>Jim Wright</persname>,
					 <persname>Terry Sanford</persname>, and other officials including
					 <persname>President Bill Clinton,</persname> and
					 <persname>Vice President Al Gore.</persname> Though some of the
					 letters are routine congratulations or requests, others document in great
					 detail his legislative relationships, activities, and appearances, and shed
					 light on political issues important to Price and his constituency at any given
					 time. It is likely that some of the outgoing letters were written by Price's
					 staff.</p>
				  <p>Topics range range widely depending on the issues of the time.
					 Letters devoted to topics of particular interest to North Carolina such as
					 National Science Foundation funding for Wake Technical Community College,
					 drilling off the North Carolina coast, an air route to London from Raleigh,
					 N.C., and funding of
					 <corpname>Environmental Protection Agency</corpname>
					 construction in Price's district. Other topics mentioned repeatedly include the

					 <subject>national budget</subject> and budget votes,
					 <subject>reproductive rights,</subject>
					 <subject>affordable housing</subject>, the
					 <subject>Americans with Disabilities Act,</subject> the
					 <subject>1988 Civil Rights Restoration Act, </subject>
					 <subject>crime bills,</subject> the
					 <subject>Title X Gag Rule,</subject> the
					 <subject>Persian Gulf War,</subject> gun control especially
					 regarding assault weapons and the
					 <subject>Brady Bill,</subject> the environment, energy policy,
					 <subject>surface transportation, </subject>
					 <subject>appropriations bills,</subject> the
					 <subject>Super Collider</subject> project, the
					 <subject>Freedom of Choice Act,</subject> the
					 <subject>Student Loan Affordability Act</subject>,
					 <subject>health care reform</subject>, the
					 <subject>Scientific and Technical Education Act of
						1992,</subject> and the
					 <subject>North American Free Trade Agreement</subject>
					 (NAFTA).</p>
				  <p>Constituent letters were often copied and attached to letters
					 sent to Price's colleagues, government agencies, or VIPs. Similarly, much of
					 the mail in this series could be described as
					 <genreform>issue mail</genreform> since issues are discussed
					 throughout, but Price also maintained a separate file with this
					 designation.</p>
				  <p>See also correspondence in the <emph render="bold">Member
					 Files</emph> subseries of the <emph render="bold">Personal/Political
					 Files.</emph> There is also correspondence throughout the <emph render="bold">Pre-Congressional Papers,</emph> some in the <emph render="bold">Campaign Files</emph> of the <emph render="bold">Personal/Political Files,</emph> and spread throughout the entire
					 collection.</p>
				  <p>Correspondence files are arranged by year, and then by type of
					 correspondent. </p>

				  memos, Congressional Research Service documents, targeted mailings, newsletters
				  from a variety of organizations, notes, committee testimony, and speeches, all
				  documenting Price's participation in the introduction and movement of bills, his
				  general legislative interests, impact, and influence, as well as the
				  interaction of legislative concerns and interests with the pressures of his
				  constituency. It is unclear whether this was a central file in Price's office,
				  whether it belonged to Price or another staff member, or whether it was shared
				  by several staffers who worked on legislative initiatives and policy decisions
				  with Price. </p>
				<p>The most common correspondents are Price, other members of
				  Congress, and Senators involved in the legislative initiative, especially those
				  serving on a relevant committee. Letters from constituents and constituent
				  organizations on particular issues are often found in these files, as are
				  Price's responses. Another significant document type frequently found in these
				  files is the briefing memo, sent between staff members of Price's office, which
				  serve as direct evidence of how Price's staff worked together on issues,
				  communicated their expertise to him, and developed policy positions and
				  legislative initiatives.</p>
				<p>Most files are arranged in subseries according to
				  House committee areas of jurisdiction. Within
				  most subseries, the files are not arranged in any particular order. Committee
				  and subcommittee structures and their names changed over time, and very often one
				  committee's jurisdiction will overlap another's. Familiarity with committee
				  jurisdictions of the late 1980s and 1990s will be helpful in searching these
				  files. </p>

					 University and Meredith College. Organizations mentioned frequently include the

					 [Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations] legislation; unemployment;

					 well as his time as co-chair of the Literacy Task Force of the Sunbelt Caucus.

					 education; student financial aid;
					 <subject>literacy; </subject> Goals 2000: Educate America Act;
					 national service legislation; standardized testing;

					 issues. Other topics present seem to relate to this committee area tangentially
					 such as files on infant mortality. </p>

				<scopecontent>
				  <p>Contains documents related to a variety of topics, chiefly
					 <subject>energy production</subject> and the
					 <subject>environment.</subject> Issues and legislative
					 initiatives vary widely but often relate to the environment, including the
					 following topics: clean air and wilderness; animal welfare; public health;
					 cancer hospitals; the FDA [Food and Drug Administration]; various medications;
					 maternal-child programs; Medicare; insurance and other health-related issues;
					 cable television; telecommunications; energy and utility issues; nuclear power
					 legislation; and energy policies. There is less correspondence and a higher
					 frequency of
					 <genreform>staff memos</genreform> to Price, perhaps reflecting
					 less activity in this area of legislation.</p>
				  <p> Prominent organizations in these files include: the
					 <corpname>EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] </corpname> or
					 environment-related organizations such as the
					 <corpname>Environmental Defense Fund; </corpname> certain North
					 Carolina organizations; UNC [University of North Carolina]; the State of North

					 companies;
					 <subject>public radio;</subject> and CPandL [Carolina Power and

				  <p> As in previous subseries, correspondence frequently reveals
					 evidence of legislators attempting to gain support for their initiative. The

				  <p>Consists primarily of copies of correspondence, usually

					 as commemorative, designed to raise awareness for a particular medical
					 condition or gain recognition for a cause or particular group or people (e.g.
					 Emergency Services Week). There is frequently a note appended where Price (or a
					 member of his staff) indicated his reason for cosponsoring and staff input.
					 Correspondents are usually congressional colleagues with whom the legislation
					 originated. In rough chronological order as received.</p>

			 <p>Series within this record group are devoted to particular
				campaigns, but there is overlap in content from one campaign to another due to
				recurrence of issues, themes, and constituencies. There is no series for the
				1992 campaign, but some materials for that year appear in the
				<emph render="bold">Various Campaigns Subseries.</emph> Following the
				individual campaigns are several general subseries that cover multiple
				campaigns and center on such topics as precinct analysis, redistricting, and
				polling. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> documents Price's campaigns
				and other media appearances. Primary arrangement of series is chronological for
				the biennial campaigns from 1986-1996; within these series, original
				arrangement by topic is retained. </p>
