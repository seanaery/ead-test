      <p>Roper received the following academic degrees: LL.D. from Tusculum College
(1927), LL.D from National University (1933), M.B.A. from Bryant and Stratton
College in Providence, R.I. (1933), and L.H.D. from Rollins College in Winter
Park, Fl.(1934). He was a member of the American Bar Association; the Board of
Stewards; the Democratic Party; the Board of Directors for the Atlantic Coast
Line Railway; the Board of Education in Washington, D.C. (1932); the General
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (1930); the 6th Ecumenical
Conference (1931); Sigma Alpha Epsilon; Phi Beta Kappa; the Chevy Chase Club;
the National Press Club; the University Club (Washington, D.C.); and the Masons.
He was a trustee of Coker College and the American University. Roper was the
author of The United States Post Office (1917) and Fifty Years in Public Life
(1941).</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Daniel C. Roper Papers, 1860-1958 (bulk 1933-1938), consist
chiefly of professional and political correspondence, including telegrams and
memoranda, but also include speeches, financial papers, clippings, invitations,
legal papers, printed material, and pictures. The collection primarily
documents Roper's term as Secretary of Commerce during the first
administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In general the papers
provide an inside look at this Democratic administration during the early
depression years, as well as the relationships among business, government,
and politics. In particular, Roper had close ties to people in the business
community and was sympathetic to their concerns. In addition, the collection
tracks the course of the New Deal in the Department of Commerce and the
career of Roper not only as a United States government official in
Roosevelt's cabinet but also as a progressive Democrat. However, there are
some gaps in these professional files in that there is very little material
pertaining to Roper's career prior to his appointment to the cabinet post.
Also, files for 1931 are almost entirely missing, and cross-reference sheets in
the collection prepared by Roper's staff appear to refer to a separate set of
files missing from this collection. There is relatively little in the papers
concerning Roper's personal life, except for financial papers.</p>
      <p>Roper's tenure as Secretary of Commerce is primarily documented in the
Alphabetical Series, which not only is the largest series but also forms the
heart of the collection. His support of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932
presidential campaign probably helped him earn this cabinet appointment
along with Roper's representation of the old Woodrow Wilson element in the
Democratic Party. Roper set as a major task the development of mutual
confidence, cooperation, and a closer relationship between business and
government in order to bring about a recovery from the depression. Since he
had been a tax expert and business consultant prior to becoming Secretary,
this was a natural role for him. In fact in 1933 he had organized a Business
Advisory and Planning Council for the Department of Commerce to advise
the administration on the effect of the New Deal's proposals on business.
After serving in the administration for almost six years, Roper resigned to
return to private life.</p>
      <p>The Alphabetical Series includes correspondence from a large number of
prominent senators and congressmen, men in government service,
businessmen, lawyers, judges, and New Deal figures. These include Bernard
Baruch, James Byrnes, Patrick Callahan, James Cannon, Thomas
Chadbourne, David Coker, Homer Cummings, Josephus Daniels, William
Dodd, Ernest Draper, Robert Elbert, James Farley, John Garner, and W.
Averell Harriman. Other correspondents are William Henry Harrison,
Edward House, Louis Howe Cordell Hull, Clarence Hurrey, Jesse Jones,
Hugh MacRae, William Gibbs McAdoo, George Milton, Robert Owen,
Hollins Randolph, Lawrence Robert, L.S. Rowe, and John Humphrey Small.
The Farley correspondence includes a run of first day covers, 1933-1938,
while he was Postmaster General. Roper's interest in the stamps was piqued
in part by the fact that he had been the First Assistant Postmaster General
appointed by Woodrow Wilson. There are smaller amounts of
correspondence with other New Deal figures, such as Harry Hopkins,
Frances Perkins, and Harold Ickes.</p>
      <p>Information on organizations and topics is scattered throughout the
Alphabetical Series. They include aeronautics (in Aviation folder); American
University; the Board of Education of the District of Columbia; commerce
(in Foreign Trade folder); communication (radio and telegraph); financial
federations, specifically The Community Chest of Washington, D.C.; the
Democratic National Committee; the Democratic Party (in Politics folder);
Duke University; the Export-Import Bank of Washington; and the
Hindenburg accident. Others are the Freemasons (in Masons folder);
Japanese Economic Mission to the United States; the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South (also in Methodist Church and Mt. Vernon Place Church
folders); the National Benefit Life Assurance Company; the National
Recovery Administration; the Post Office Department; the presidential
election of 1932 (in Politics folder); prohibition; religion and politics;
Franklin D. Roosevelt; and temperance and liquor laws (in Liquor Control
folder). Roper supported prohibition and in fact had served during the
prohibition era as Commissioner of Internal Revenue in the Treasury
Department, charged with enforcing liquor laws. There is information about
agencies within or related to the Department of Commerce including the
Business Advisory Council, the Bureau of the Census (in Census folder), the
Bureau of Fisheries (in Fisheries folder), and the Bureau of Foreign and
Domestic Commerce (in Foreign and Domestic folder). Other topics
represented in the collection include the Boxing Bill; the Communications
Group; the Inter-departmental Communications Committee (in
Communications Committee folder), probably a precursor of the Federal
Communications Commission; and a proposed National Advisory
Council.</p>
      <p>Roper's professional views are expressed in the Writings and Speeches
Series primarily while he served as Commissioner of Internal Revenue and as
Secretary of Commerce. The speeches address a number of domestic political
and economic issues, including the relationship of business and government,
government regulation, taxation, economic recovery from the depression, the
U.S. Postal Service, and the role of government in society.</p>
      <p>There is scant evidence in these papers relating to Roper's career other
than that as Secretary of Commerce and his speeches as Commissioner of
Internal Revenue. His autobiography, Fifty Years of Public Life in the
Writings and Speeches Series, gives an overview of his career. There is some
information on his career as the First Assistant Postmaster General in the
Alphabetical Series in the Postmaster General file. In that series there is a
little information in Internal Revenue Service folders about his resignation as
Commissioner. In the Clippings Series there is documentation of his brief
service as U.S. Minister to Canada in the summer of 1939. There is a
scrapbook, "My Clippings of Their Majesties' Visit to Canada, 1939," and
loose clippings pertaining to the visit.</p>
      <p>Roper's personal life is not well documented in the collection except for
his financial concerns as seen in the Financial Papers Series. The information
in that series relates not only to the investments and bank accounts of Roper
but to his wife Lou McKenzie Roper and their children. There is some
additional information on the Ropers in the various Roper folders and in
other scattered folders under various topics in the Alphabetical Series, and in
the Legal Papers and Pictures in the Miscellaneous Series.</p>
      <p>A photograph album entitled, "Sugar: Story in Pictures," concerning
sugar growing in Santo Domingo appears in the Miscellaneous Series. In
addition this series contains photographs of prominent statesmen and others,
such as Bernard Baruch, the British Royal family, William Jennings Bryan,
Grover Cleveland, Josephus Daniels, Averell Harriman, Harold Ickes,
Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and
Woodrow Wilson. An oil portrait of Roper is in the custody of the Special
Collections Library. The Clippings Series includes scattered information on
farming in South Carolina, especially cotton, African Americans, racial
relations, tariffs, the presidential campaign of 1924 and William Gibbs
McAdoo, and Roosevelt's cabinet.</p>

          <p>Chiefly typed, professional correspondence to and from Roper, including telegrams, memoranda and carbon copies of Roper's outgoing mail. The bulk was generated during Roper's tenure as Secretary of Commerce. A variety of other material scattered throughout the files includes printed material in the form of pamphlets, booklets, and serials; press releases from the Department of Commerce; reports; addresses by Roper and others; charts and graphs; organizational records from various groups including minutes, budgets, and agendas; clippings; and photographs. A series of folders contains first day covers given to Roper by Postmaster James A. Farley. There is a small amount of personal correspondence and financial information. Two volumes of correspondence are at the end of the series. They are a letterbook of congratulations upon Roper's appointment as Secretary of Commerce with copies of Roper's replies, and "Special Letters of Congratulation to Daniel C. Roper, March 4, 1933," with Roper's replies. Cross-reference sheets prepared by Roper's staff are found frequently throughout the series, many of which appear to refer to a separate set of files not in this collection.</p>
