		  Affairs (Chair), Subcommittee on African Affairs, and Subcommittee on Western
		  Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs.</p>
      <p>Senator Sanford's 1986 and 1992 campaigns are portrayed in the
		  <ref linktype="simple" target="pres"> Press Files Series</ref>, particularly in the

		  <ref linktype="simple" target="cons"> Constituent Services Series</ref>. Both letters
		  from constituents to Sanford and samples of standard form replies are included.

		  <ref linktype="simple" target="pers"> Personal/Political Series</ref>. The Videos
		  Subseries of the
		  <ref linktype="simple" target="pres"> Press Files Series</ref> includes lobbying material

		  Sanford's life and career. The Duke University Archives has records pertaining
		  to Sanford's Presidency of Duke. Papers relating to his governorship are in the
		  North Carolina Archives. His personal papers are among the holdings of the
		  Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina.</p>

		  printed material related to Sanford's political career, involvement in
		  community, and membership in various organizations. They include files
		  regarding the 517th Infantry (chiefly newsletters), a Battle of the Bulge
		  reunion (1990), Central American affairs, and "miscellaneous memberships".

		  17 related micro-audio cassette tapes from July 1991 to March 1992; and other
		  miscellaneous material concerning his senatorial campaigns of 1986 and 1992 and
