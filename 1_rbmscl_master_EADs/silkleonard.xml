<head>Biographical Note</head>

<p>Leonard Solomon Silk, a journalist of economics, was born on May 15, 1918 in Philadelphia, and passed away in 1995 in Montclair, New Jersey.  He entered Dickinson College in Pennsylvania in 1936 and transferred to The University of Wisconsin on a scholarship the following year.  There he began his journalistic career, editing the humor magazine <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Octopus</title>.  He also became influenced by the cutting-edge economics department, and professors such as Selig Perlman.  Silk entered Duke University in 1940 for graduate study in economics; his mentor at Duke was international economist Calvin Bryce Hoover.  His graduate study was interrupted during World War II when he enlisted in the Army Air Forces. He worked as a Morse code operator in Alaska, but also wrote for <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Yank</title> and other Army publications.  In this capacity, he covered the 1945 founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco.  Upon his return to graduate study in 1946, he travelled to Sweden to study the Swedish housing system.  He published an article on this research in <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Fortune </title>magazine; a longer version of which became his Ph.D. thesis and subsequently his first book, <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sweden Plans for Better Housing</title> (1948), published by Duke University Press.</p>

<p>Silk is most well known as a columnist and editorial writer for <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The New York Times</title> and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Business Week</title>. He was one of the first journalists known for making complex economic issues understandable to the average reader. He became a full-time columnist for <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The New York Times</title> from 1976-1993 and published a column twice weekly in the business pages under the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Economic Scene</title> rubric.  In later years he also frequently wrote major news stories on economic issues.</p>

<p>In addition to his journalistic work, Silk taught economics at the University of Maine, Simmons College in Boston, the University of Oslo, and Pace University.  He was a Senior Research Fellow on the United Nations for the Ralph Bunche Institute at the City University of New York, and a Senior Fellow of the Brookings Institution.  He worked for the federal government in various positions such as a housing expert and an economist for the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p>

<p>Silk expanded much of his journalistic research into books; his most well known are <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Economics in Plain English</title> (1978), <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Economics in the Real World</title> (1984), and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The American Establishment</title>.</p>

<p>Silk was drawn to economics by the Great Depression. During his undergraduate study at the University of Wisconsin, he was influenced by Keynesian theory and recently popularized views that economists should study micro-economics and not just macro-economics. Eventually Silk moved away from Keynesian theory, but advocated both government regulation and deregulation based on the particular economic situation. He viewed economics as a branch of philosophy and believed that economics should improve the quality of life for people, especially the disadvantaged.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The papers of Leonard Silk span the years 1929 to 1985, with the majority dating between 1950 and 1985. The collection is arranged by original accessions, within which there are divisions by format. There are many of these, and they typically include correspondence files; printed material such as periodicals and reports; research or subject files; newspaper clippings files; drafts of writings, including Silk's books, news columns, editorials, speeches, lectures, book reviews, and essays; papers and reprints by Silk's colleagues; organizations files; publicity and informal photographs of Silk; financial documents; economic data such as forecasts and tables, much of it reported by the U.S. government; some teaching materials such as reading lists; and theses and dissertations (including Silk's own thesis on Swedish housing policies, 1947). There are also groups of cards, notes, memos, calendars and agendas, and some minutes of meetings relating to organizations with which Silk was involved. Leonard Silk's papers are a vast and rich resource for learning about the intersection of politics, economics, and popular opinion in the 20th century, U.S. fiscal policies, global economics, trends in social institutions in the U.S., and specific topics as American business, unemployment, inflation, banking, macroeconomics and Keynesian economics, markets and marketing (pharmaceutical and tobacco, among others), the economies of Asian countries such as Japan, and many other subjects. A more detailed original paper inventory is available in the library; in it, significant portions of the correspondence are listed at the item level, including correspondents' names; separated book titles are also listed individually. Many groups of other materials, however, are described only by number of pieces.</p>

<p>In the correspondence files, many of them arranged in chronological order, the majority of the letters are addressed to Silk, but there are also some written by him. Significant correspondents include writers and journalists as well as well-known political figures and economists too numerous to mention. A search using key words may be helpful in locating particular individuals.</p>

<p>The largest group of materials in the collection consists of print items. Silk assembled extensive research files of clippings, articles, periodicals, reports, government publications, and reprints. All of these supported his current research interests, which ranged widely but chiefly focused on macroeconomics, Keynesian economic theory, economics for the social good, and banking and finance. He also set aside pamphlets, tables and charts, and even maps related to his travels.</p>

<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection has been given basic processing and is in the original order as received. The largest divisions represent additions to the Silk Papers, numbered by year and dated, each of which is made up of format groupings such as correspondence, reports, and subject files, which appear randomly throughout each addition. Within those groupings there is often an original alphabetical order, particularly for subject files and correspondence. Keyword searching can be used to uncover specific topics or names in this large collection.</p>
<p>Gaps in the box number sequence come from separated print materials, which are no longer housed with the manuscript collection. See the administrative sections at the beginning of this collection guide for more information.</p>

<separatedmaterial>
<head>Separated Material</head>
<p>At the University of Wyoming, and later, upon arrival of the collection at Duke, boxes of selected print material such as books and pamphlets were separated from the personal papers represented in this collection guide. At Duke, large groupings of print material have been transferred to the Perkins Library general collections or to the holdings of the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Gaps in the box number sequence reflect these separated boxes. The original paper finding aid lists most but not all of the books originally in the collection by title. Please contact a reference archivist in the Duke David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library for assistance in locating materials.</p>

<p>Throughout this addition, the largest in the collection, there are large groups of reprints, correspondence, reports, and other print materials. There are three divisions with alphabetical sub-series. The first runs through Box 50 and contains the largest subject files series in the collection (12 boxes). Beginning with Box 51, the alphabetical arrangement starts over at with Advertisements and Announcements. At Box 108 another alphabetical arrangement begins with Charts and Documents. This last sub-series houses many printed materials, and includes a set of interviews of notable individuals conducted by Silk.</p>
<p>There are large amounts of correspondence throughout the addition (1940s-1980s), equally large series of subject files, and series of memoranda (1935-1980s) exchanged between Silk and various individuals. Also of interest are large series of manuscripts, galley proofs, and other writings by Silk as well as by others; many folders of speeches assembled by Silk; groups of expert testimony, with statements from economists such as Arthur Burns; economic forecasts; a group of serial essays on economics published by the University of Chicago; and various publications and newsletters. There are also groups of photographs of Silk scattered throughout (Boxes 32, 51 and 124 especially). Finally, Silk's original thesis, Duke University 1947, <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Social Housing Policy in Sweden,</title> is in Box 49 of this addition.</p>
<p>Gaps in the box number sequence reflect separated print material. See the administrative sections at the top of this collection guide for more information. A more detailed original paper inventory is available in the library; in it significant portions of the correspondence are listed at the item level, including correspondents' names.</p>
