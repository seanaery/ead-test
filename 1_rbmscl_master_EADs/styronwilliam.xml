      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The William Styron Papers span the years 1855-2007 with the bulk of the papers being dated between 1943 and 1996.  The collection is arranged into the following series: Correspondence, Writings by Styron (which includes Separate Publications, Contributions to Books and Periodicals, Speeches, Unfinished Work, and Miscellaneous Writings), Writings by Others, Printed Material, Audiovisual Material, Scrapbooks, and Miscellaneous Material. Extensive personal and professional correspondence between Styron and his family, friends, editors, and fellow authors provides insight into his education at Duke University (particularly his studies with Professor William Blackburn of the Department of English) as well as his literary career and personal life.  The Writings by Styron Series includes numerous drafts, notes, manuscripts, and proofs of his novels, essays, speeches, and articles.  Critical and analytical works concerning Styron's writing can be found in both the Printed Material Series and the Writings by Others Series.  Interviews with Styron are to be found in both the Interviews section of the Writings by Others Series and in the Audiovisual Material Series.</p>
      <p>Numerous American authors are represented in the collection in the Correspondence Series as well as in the Writings by Others Series.  Among the major correspondents are Robert Penn Warren, Carlos Fuentes, Norman Mailer, and Reynolds Price.  Letters from Eudora Welty, Truman Capote, Art Buchwald, Richard Wilbur, Kurt Vonnegut, William Kennedy, and James Dickey are also included.  A separate index to some of the letters by well-known authors and celebrities accompanies the collection.  The Writings by Others Series also includes limited edition copies of poems by Reynolds Price and Allen Tate.</p>
      <p>Styron's close relationship with his family is documented in the early letters of the Correspondence Series as well as in the scrapbooks kept by his father.  The latter include much juvenilia and childhood memorabilia as well as clippings documenting his early literary accomplishments.  A diary kept by Styron during the year following his mother's death appears in the Writings by Styron Series: Miscellaneous Writings Subseries.  The Audiovisual Material Series includes several family photographs.  Videotapes in this series also provide much information about his life and work.</p>
      <p>Among the Writings by Styron are numerous holograph notes, manuscripts written in pencil, and printed texts and typescripts with revisions.  These provide detailed insight into Styron's creative process and enable the researcher to document the evolution of much of Styron's work.  Research material used by Styron for some of his work, particularly <title linktype="simple" render="italic">The Confessions of Nat Turner,</title> appears among the volumes in the Printed Material Series.</p>
      <p>Styron's experience with having his work filmed for both television and the cinema is documented by screenplays of <title linktype="simple" render="italic">The Long March</title> and <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Sophie's Choice.</title>  Several photographs of the latter production appear in the Audiovisual Material Series.  A screenplay of <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Set This House on Fire,</title> a first draft of a screenplay of <title linktype="simple" render="italic">Lie Down in Darkness,</title> and a step outline of <title linktype="simple" render="italic">The Confessions of Nat Turner,</title> none of which were produced, also appear in the Writings by Others Series</p>

<p>Unprocessed addition (06-105) (0.4 lin. ft) contains Styron's copy of The Confessions of Nat Turner and a binder of letters from Styron to Bertha Krantz, Robert D. Loomis, and others, 1967-1993.</p>	  
<p>Unprocessed addition (07-145) (6 items, 0.1 lin. ft.; dated 2007) contains copies of material from Styron's memorial service, including the program, book of reminiscences, and transcript. This material is boxed in box 1 of 08-142.</p>
<p>Unprocessed addition (08-012) (0.8 lin. ft.; 600 items; dated 1943-2006 and undated) includes published and unpublished essays, drafts, speeches, and writings by Styron, as well as copies of letters to his father (1943-1952) and correspondence from his wife, Rose, from around the time of his death in 2006. Also includes a leather portfolio with drafts of his work, photographs, clippings, and a photograph album from his daughter's film, Shadrach.</p>
<p>Unprocessed addition (08-072) (180 items, .6 lin. ft.; dated 1990-2003 and undated) comprises mainly letters to Styron regarding his works, especially DARKNESS VISIBLE. Also includes letters regarding appearances requested or planned.</p>
<p>Unprocessed addition (08-142) (388 items, .8 lin. ft; dated 1966-2007 and undated) mainly comprises incoming correspondence, which occasionally contains clippings, photographs, and other incidental materials. In addition, includes original manuscripts for several short works by the author, many annotated, as well as some handwritten manuscript pages for SOPHIE'S CHOICE. There are also two dvds of Styron's memorial service. Box 1 of this material includes Acc. 07-145.</p>
<p>Unprocessed addition (08-294) (0.4 lin. ft.; 300 items) was acquired and donated by James West III, and includes manuscripts, essays, edited drafts, and speeches by Styron. Each manuscript includes a cover page by West describing the condition of the materials. This material is boxed with Acc. 08/012.</p>
<p>Addition (11-142) (0.6 lin. ft.; 500 items) was donated by Styron's editor, Robert Loomis. It includes drafts and clippings, as well as photographs used in Styron publications.</p>
