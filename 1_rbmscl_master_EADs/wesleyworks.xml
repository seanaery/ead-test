<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">The Wesley Works Editorial Project, founded in 1960, is an international and inter denominational consortium of scholars that is producing a complete critical edition of the works of John Wesley, the 18th century Church of England clergyman who was a primary founder of Methodism. </abstract>

<abstract encodinganalog="520">The Wesley Works Archive, dating from 1676 to 1996, with the bulk ranging from 1724-1791 and 1960-1996, forms part of the working papers of the Wesley Works Editorial Project (WWEP). The collection consists of that portion of the project's documents gathered by Frank Baker during almost four decades of service as the WWEP's editor and main bibliographer, and consists of the correspondence, writings, research, printed materials, photocopied manuscripts, proofs, and other materials produced by Baker and the many other historians, theologians, and clergy, who have participated in the Project. There is much information not only about the founding and early history of the Methodist and Wesleyan Methodist Churches, but also about the history of religious thought and dissent in 18th century England, the Evangelical Revival, and the history of publishing; materials in the collection also throw light on such topics as scholarly publishing and textual criticism.</abstract>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The <emph render="bold">Wesley Works Archive, 1676-1996 and undated, bulk 1724-1791, 1960-1996,</emph> forms part of the working papers of the Wesley Works Editorial Project (WWEP). Formed in 1960, this international and inter denominational consortium of scholars is producing a complete critical edition of the works of John Wesley, the 18th century Church of England clergyman who was a primary founder of Methodism. The collection consists of that portion of the Project's documents gathered by Frank Baker during almost four decades of service as the WWEP's General Editor, Textual Editor, and main bibliographer, and consists of the correspondence, writings, research, printed materials, photocopied manuscripts, proofs, and other materials produced by Baker and the many other historians, theologians, and clergy, who have participated in the Project. Because John Wesley preached, wrote, and published so widely, the content of the research materials  required for a full edition of his writings necessarily contains much information not only about the founding and early history of the Methodist and Wesleyan Methodist Churches, but also much information about the history of religious thought and dissent in 18th century England, the Evangelical Revival, and the history of publishing. Beyond the ostensible purpose of the WWEP, however, the modern correspondence and scholarly debate contained in these papers also throws light on such topics as scholarly publishing and textual criticism.</p>

<p>The collection also sheds light on the history and mechanics of the transmission of texts. That is, while the reproduced printed materials here document the complex publishing and textual history of the thousands of editions of Wesley's writings to appear in his lifetime alone, at the same time the original writings of modern scholars involved in the WWEP document how older texts are researched and recovered from the past, all for the purpose of establishing a present authoritative text to be passed on to the future.</p>

<p>Series in the Wesley Works Archive are arranged to correspond to the unit structure of the thirty-five volume <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title>. Described more fully below, the initial sixteen series of the archive and the sixteen units and thirty-five volumes of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title> are as follows:  <emph render="bold"><emph render="italic">Sermons</emph> (1-4); <emph render="italic">Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament</emph> (5-6); <emph render="italic">A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People called Methodists</emph> (7); <emph render="italic">Worship </emph>(8); <emph render="italic">The Methodist Societies</emph> (9-10); <emph render="italic">The Appeals to Men of Reason and Religion and Certain Related Open Letters</emph> (11); <emph render="italic">Doctrinal and Controversial Treatises</emph> (12-13); <emph render="italic">Social/Political Tracts</emph> (14); <emph render="italic">Catechetical/Educational Works</emph> (15); <emph render="italic">Editorial Works</emph> (16); <emph render="italic">Medical Writings</emph> (17); <emph render="italic">Journals and Diaries</emph> (18-24); <emph render="italic">Letters</emph> (25-31); <emph render="italic">Oxford Diaries</emph> (32); <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph> (33-34);</emph> and <emph render="bold"><emph render="italic">Index and Miscellanea</emph> (35).</emph> A concluding seventeenth series, <emph render="bold">General Files</emph>, gathers materials about the overall history and organization of the WWEP.</p>


<p>The history of the Wesley Works Editorial Project already extends more than fifty years, from its inception in 1960 to the 2011 publication of <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Methodist Societies: The Minutes of Conference</title>. This volume, as the seventeenth to be published, marks the halfway point of the entire <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition,</title> which will comprise thirty-four volumes plus a concluding general index volume. Although the <emph render="bold">General Files</emph> are placed as the final series in order to avoid interrupting the parallel structure of series and volumes, they actually mark the best place to begin an overview of the collection, since their various folder groups document much of the administrative history of the Project. Overviews and details of the Project's inception, history, institutional support, and editorial guidelines are best found in the folder groups for the Board of Directors and the Editorial Board.  The history of the actual content, intellectual structure, and presentation of volumes can be found in such groups as grouped under such categories as Editorial Procedures and Bulletins of the WWP. Most of the latter were issued by Frank Baker in the 1970s and contain much detail about the content and style choices that were being made for various volumes. The General Files also contain materials that may relate to more than one unit of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition,</title> as well as some Wesley publications not selected for inclusion, especially his <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Explanatory Notes Upon the Old Testament.</title></p>


<p>The first series in the collection, <title render="italic" linktype="simple"><emph render="bold">Sermons</emph></title> is also its largest. It may also provide the fullest and most detailed record of the editorial process and scholarly debate behind the production of these volumes. It documents almost twenty years of work by two men often regarded as the leading Wesleyan scholars of their generation, Albert Outler and Frank Baker, to research, compile, and edit the first four volumes of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition,</title> which contain authoritative critical texts of 151 of John Wesley's sermons. Since most of these sermons appeared in several editions during Wesley's lifetime, many of these printings included not only Wesley's intended revisions over time, but also incorporated a host of printers' errors over the course of several decades. Many of individual sermons contain copies of ten or more editions photocopied here, and some contain over thirty. Untangling this history to arrive at Wesley's intended text was the task of Outler as unit editor for the <emph render="italic">Sermons</emph>, in tandem with Baker as Textual Editor and Editor-in-Chief. Their correspondence documents not only their ongoing partnership, but also their sometimes heated exchanges over the exact reading and presentation of texts that lie at the foundation and perhaps the heart of Methodist history, doctrine, and belief.
</p>

<p>The next series, <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Explanatory Notes upon the New Testament</title></emph>, houses correspondence, research, and typescripts for Volumes 5 and 6, still in preparation as of 2011. Most of the material here documents the efforts of Baker and the original unit editor, John Lawson, to arrive at a full working draft of John Wesley's commentary on the New Testament. There is also material concerning <title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Remains or Several Select Scriptures Of the New Testament opened and explained</title>  of Robert Gell, D. D. (1676), an Arminian commentary on the New Testament. An extensive, perhaps full, photocopy of this edition of "Gell's Remains" is included here, along with notes by Baker in which he traces Gell's influence on Wesley.</p>

<p>One of the earlier volumes published, in 1983, is represented in the series <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">A Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People called Methodists.</title></emph> This volume focused on printing a critical text of John Wesley's most famous and popular collection of hymns, which first appeared in 1780 and has gone through many editions since then. Discussion, planning, and research for Volume 7 began in the mid-1960s and is documented by a large volume of correspondence between Baker and the two unit editors, Franz Hildebrandt and Oliver Beckerlegge.</p>

<p>The <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Worship</title> Series</emph> holds materials for Volume 8, a forthcoming collection of John Wesley's printed liturgical works. The  materials here reflect early stages in the editorial process, consisting mainly of extensive photocopies and typescripts that were compiled in the late 1970s and early 1980s in order to derive stemma and establish authoritative texts. Despite the early date of these materials in the history of the project, they include a full preliminary typescript of Volume 8, edited by Baker. Another highlight here is some later, related work Frank Baker did on <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Hymns on the Lord's Supper,</title> resulting in a 1995 address to a meeting of the Charles Wesley Society. </p>

<p><emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Methodist Societies</title></emph> unit is divided into two volumes and subseries:  <title render="italic" linktype="simple">History, Nature, and Design</title> (Vol. 9); and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Minutes of the Conference</title> (Vol. 10). Completed in 1989, <emph render="italic">History, Nature, and Design</emph> collects a variety of documents, published intermittently throughout Wesley's life, in which in which he attempted to define what a Methodist and Methodism were, and how its societies were to be organized within the Church of England. The materials gathered here  contain research, typescripts, and proofs that outline the entire history of the volume's inception, development, and publication. <emph render="italic">Minutes of the Conference,</emph> on the other hand, did not appear until 2011, some twenty to thirty years after these materials were researched and written, so this subseries reflects only the early stages of the volume's  development. The subseries consists mainly of photocopies, although many have been densely annotated by Baker, collated, and transcribed into preliminary typescripts. The highlight of this subseries may lie in Baker's unpublished index of John Wesley's preachers. Deemed too long for the published volume, this work compiles brief but detailed chronologies of some 600 18th Methodist preachers in England: where they served, when they moved, and other highlights of their lives and careers.</p>

<p>The next series holds materials for the first-published volume of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition,</title> 1975's <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">The Appeals to Men of Reason and Religion and Certain Related Open Letters</title></emph> (Vol. 11). The <emph render="italic">Appeals</emph> volume gathers  printed materials and open letters by Wesley in which he attempted to publicly clarify his ecclesiastical and theological positions, sometimes out of the need to respond to attacks and correct public misconceptions of the Methodist societies. </p>

<p>Several small series appear in the middle of the collection, reflecting the relatively small amounts of materials Baker had in hand for six volumes (Vols. 12-17) that remain in preparation as of 2011. Even despite this gap of time, though, the series <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Doctrinal and Controversial Treatises</title></emph> (Vols. 12-13), <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Social/Political Tracts</title></emph> (Vol. 14), and <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Catechetical/Educational Works</title></emph> (Vol. 15) each contain several hundred pages of preliminary typescripts, some of them with Baker's notes on stemma prepared in the early 1980s. The even smaller <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Editorial Works</title> Series</emph> contains only a few folders, the most important of which is an early introduction to the volume written by the original unit editor, T. Walter Herbert, in 1981. The last of the small series found in this portion of the collection, <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Medical Writings</title></emph> is chiefly notable for containing some of the most recent materials in the archive, dating to the mid-1990s. Almost all of this material stems from the work of James Donat, who began corresponding with Baker in the 1990s about some of Wesley's medical writings for which he was preparing texts, entirely separately from the WWEP. Donat eventually became co-editor (along with Randy Maddox) of this volume.</p>

<p>The next series, <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Journals and Diaries</title></emph>, is among the largest in the collection, covers one of the two largest units in the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition,</title> and is also co-edited by Richard P. Heitzenrater, who succeeded Baker as  General Editor for the WWEP. Heitzenrater is also the editor of a later, closely-related series, the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Oxford Diaries</title> (Volume 32). There is no material in the collection related to this volume-in-preparation, but materials housed elsewhere may pertain to it.</p>

<p>The seven volumes of John Wesley's letters comprised one of the two units of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title> for which Frank Baker was originally slated to be unit editor. Although he completed only the first two of those volumes--<title render="italic" linktype="simple">Letters I: 1721-1739</title> and <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Letters II: 1740-1755</title> (Volumes 25 and 26, respectively)--the <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Letters</title> Series</emph> contains not only those materials but many more that Baker gathered in preparation for the entire series. The series is arranged in two large subseries, <emph render="bold">General Files</emph> and <emph render="bold">Volumes.</emph> The latter is composed mainly of materials specific to the two volumes published during Baker's lifetime, including correspondence, notes, and many versions of typescripts and proofs. The General Files Subseries, however, contains materials for Baker's preparation for all seven volumes, some of which extend well past the 1755 end-date of Volume 26. Among the highlights here are the hundreds of photocopies of manuscript letters, both to and from Wesley, collected from archives around the world. Although these are in theory available from the original holding archive, where known, the fact of their being collected in single place makes this a valuable resource for studying Wesley's correspondence and correspondents. Another item of interest, entirely unique to this collection, is the notebook labeled "Early log of Wesley letters." Undated but probably from the mid-1970s to early 1980s, this notebook sheds light on Baker's research methods as well as providing a resource for studying Wesley's correspondence. It lists in chronological order,  from 1725 to 1791, the date, place written, recipient, place received, prior publication if any, and present archival location of some 4000 John Wesley manuscript letters around the world. Its content  extends well beyond the content presently available in either the published volumes of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title> or in the previous standard for Wesley's letters, the Telford edition.</p>

<p>Before the most complex series in the Archive, the Bibliography Series, is described, <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Index and Miscellanea</title> Series</emph> requires only a brief mention. It contains a small amount of material for the concluding volume of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition,</title> not to be published until all the other volumes are complete. As well as providing a general index to the entire set, this volume will also present background materials that explain rationales the editors used to decide for or against modernization of diction, spelling, punctuation, and many other issues involved in faithfully presenting Wesley's texts to a modern audience.</p>


<p>Prior to the Index, though, the penultimate unit of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title> is represented in the <emph render="italic">Bibliography </emph> Series. Aside from the Letters, this was the only other portion for which Frank Baker served as the original unit editor. Planned as Volumes 33-34 but left incomplete at his death, the <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph> was only one instantiation of a topic on which he labored for several decades: documenting the publishing history of the editions of their writings that appeared in print during the lifetimes of John and Charles Wesley.  Independently of his work on the WWEP, and yet also in preparation for it, Baker had already published <title render="italic" linktype="simple">A Union Catalogue of the Publications of John and Charles Wesley</title> in 1966. Although this title and the work-in-progress he called "A Descriptive and Analytical Bibliography" may at first sound like two names for more or less the same thing, the latter is in fact a radically different work. The words "descriptive" and "analytical" in the title were not added lightly: each publication with a completed entry in the bibliography is taken up and considered in a full-length essay. Baker of course provides the expected bibliographic details for all editions to appear in Wesley's lifetime, derives the stemma or publishing genealogy of each work, and lists holdings around the world, just as in the Union Catalogue. But here he does far more. He also discusses each work's place in the Wesley canon, considers everything from how and why it came to be written and published, to its reception history, to the ways Wesley used and adapted it in successive printings over the years. In short, the drafts and typescripts collected here, though uncompleted, go well beyond "bibliography" or even "annotated bibliography" as those terms are generally conceived. They set out to describe in full a publishing phenomenon that spanned two-thirds of the 18th century: the life in print of a speaker, writer, editor, and abridger whose works appeared in more than four thousand editions in his own lifetime alone.</p>

<p>It comes as little surprise, then, that the <emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bibliography</title> Series</emph> should be the largest in the collection for any unpublished unit of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title>. It also has the most complex relationship  with other materials at Duke--not only with other series in the Wesley Works Archive but with other Frank Baker collections in the Rubenstein and Divinity School Libraries. In order to make full use of this network of  resources, researchers are advised to read the Bibliography Series and Subseries notes closely and to consult with Research Services staff as needed.</p>

<head>Related Material</head>

<p>The Wesley Works Archive forms part of a larger group of collections gathered by Baker during his long career as a collector and scholar. These collections, plus others housed in both the Rubenstein Library and  the Duke Divinity School Library, contain extensive related materials used by Baker and other scholars in preparing the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title>. Rubenstein Library collections are listed first, followed by Divinity School collections.

<list type="simple">
<item><emph render="bold">Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana and British Methodism (printed materials division).</emph> Holds hundreds of editions of John Wesley's sermons, hymns, journals, and editorial works, plus such organizational materials as minutes of the Methodist Conferences.

The Wesley Family Series holds a number of John Wesley's autograph letters; numerous incoming letters can also be found here and in certain subseries of the Correspondence Series. Most of these letters date after 1755 and thus have not appeared in the two volumes of letters published to date.</item>

Although in theory an entirely separate collection from the WWA, in practice there are numerous overlaps between the collections. The Libraries and Archives Series documents much of Baker's correspondence with and visits to libraries around the world, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, in the effort to document and gather as many Wesley archival and printed materials as possible. The Correspondence Series contains Baker's letters to and from many of  same correspondents and colleagues who appear in the Wesley Works Archive. And the enormous Subject Files are rich in materials related to the project, especially the numerous indexes of Wesley's letters and other writings to be found in the Card Files Subseries.</item>

Inquire at the Divinity Library Reference Desk.</item>
<item>The <emph render="bold">Frank Baker Photocopies Collection</emph> (Divinity Library) contains photocopies of several hundred of the rare monographs housed in the Rubenstein Library.

<p><emph render="bold">Research example: <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Awake, Thou That Sleepest</title>. </emph>Navigating the richness and complexity of the inter-related Frank Baker collections at Duke may be more clearly demonstrated with a specific example. The sermon "Awake, Thou That Sleepest" has been chosen for several reasons: its complex publishing history, its ties to several Baker collections, and the important fact that it sheds light on researching both John and Charles Wesley. As researchers in this field would already know, although the sermon was repeatedly collected and published by John, it was originally given by Charles, and that original delivery also accounts for the other title by which it is well-known, <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">A Sermon Preach’d on Sunday, April 4, 1742, Before the University of Oxford.</title> A thorough search of the Baker collections would retrieve all of the following resources on this sermon (i.e., in addition to the text and notes as published in Works, Vol. 1):
<list type="simple">
<item>In the <emph render="bold">WWA, Sermons Series, Stemmata Subseries</emph>, photocopies of over fifty editions from libraries around the world.</item>
<item>In the <emph render="bold">WWA, Bibliography Series, Typescripts Subseries</emph>, Baker's  essay on this sermon's publishing history. A rough draft and further notes appear in the Stemmata and Text Subseries of this same series.</item>
<item>In the <emph render="bold">Frank Baker Microfilm Collection</emph>, at least a dozen editions from various archives around the world, including one edition in Welsh (N.b.: because different archives record the titles in widely varying ways on their microfilm, the sermon should also be searched using simply the year, 1742).</item>

<p>Early dates reflect photocopies, not original materials. The Sermons series begins with the <emph render="bold">General Planning Subseries</emph>, highlighted by correspondence between Frank Baker, Albert Outler, Richard Heitzenrater, and other editors; and by a typescript of an early version of the general introduction. Following this is the <emph render="bold">Stemmata Subseries</emph>, composed of hundreds of photocopies of editions of Wesley's sermons as they were published by various 18th-century publishers, in the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Arminian Magazine,</title> and in various editions of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sermons on Several Occasions</title>. These photocopies document Frank Baker's work to derive the stemma in order to arrive at the most authentic text possible.</p>

<p>The next step in this process in documented in the <emph render="bold">Texts Subseries</emph>, which is roughly divided into two folders groups of "preliminary texts" and "styled preliminary texts."  These latter represent a later stage in the editing process, where decisions are made about spelling, punctuation, style, and other concerns to render a text that is both true to the 18th century originals and cognizant of modern readers.</p>

<p>The remaining four subseries, <emph render="bold">Sermons I, II, III, and IV</emph>, document the completion of this unit as the four volumes approached publication, one at a time, in the 1980s. Each subseries contains many versions of typescripts and proofs, many of them heavily edited by Baker and by various editors at Oxford University Press and Abingdon Press. All four volumes of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sermons</title> have been published, one each year from 1984-1987; the unit editor was Albert C. Outler.</p> </scopecontent>

</did><scopecontent> <p>Correspondence, notes, and a typescript for Volumes 12 and 13, in preparation. Although not extensive, the correspondence contains discussion between Baker and a succession of unit editors over the course of some twenty years, including original unit editors John Deschner (Vol. 12) and William R. Cannon (Vol. 13). A long typescript of almost 800 pages was prepared by Baker in 1981 for a subsequent unit editor, Robert Cushman (Vol. 12). Although this typescript is a fair copy, most of its sections contain notes on stemma and extensive bracketed notes by Baker on all aspects of the text.

</did><scopecontent> <p>Volumes 14 and 15, both still in preparation for publication, were originally conceived as a single unit to be entitled "Pastoral and Educational Works" and edited by A. Lamar Cooper. This plan lasted until at least the mid-1980s, encompassing all the materials gathered here. Since current rather than original titles are being used for the series in this inventory, the assignment of these typescripts to Volume 15 is somewhat arbitrary--in reality, there is no differentiation between the two volumes here. There are preliminary texts for each tract as originally planned for the volume; copies of a collated typescript; and correspondence.

<scopecontent> <p>This volume in preparation focuses on Wesley's writings on medicine and other topics in the sciences. In addition to a few folders of texts--mainly photocopies--at the end of the series, the materials here comprise two small groups of correspondence and research, one from the 1970s and one from 1990s. The former is concerned with general planning for this unit, which early on had the broader title, or rather theme, of "Medicine and Natural Philosophy." The later group of correspondence is mainly between Baker and James Donat, who first contacted Baker in 1995 about research he was conducting on Wesley's <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Primitive Physick,</title> independently of the Wesley Works Editorial Project. Donat now serves as co-editor of this unit along with Randy Maddox.</p> </scopecontent>

<scopecontent> <p>The Letters series (Vol. 25-31) showcases the meticulous work of Frank Baker, editor of the series: here is his correspondence with international libraries to obtain extant Wesley letters; research concerning Wesley's correspondents; and many layers of editing the letters. The Wesley Works Archive contains relevant photocopies, not original manuscripts, of JW's letters. The bulk of the materials relate to the two volumes of letters published during Baker's lifetime--volumes 25 and 26 of the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title>--which cover Wesley's letters through 1755. However, there are also some materials for volume 27 and many materials that document Baker's extensive preparation for the entire 7 volume letters unit. These last-named materials, however, actually appear first in the following arrangement, under the heading of General Planning. Following that are the materials for individual volumes of the Letters. Frank Baker was the original unit editor and saw the first two of seven volumes into publication. The unit editors for the remaining volumes are Ted Campbell and Philip Meadows.</p> </scopecontent>

<c02 level="subseries"><did><unittitle>General Planning Subseries, <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1724-1996</unitdate> and undated</unittitle></did>
<scopecontent> <p>The General Planning Subseries is arranged in several folder groups that outline Baker's extensive preparations for the entire Letters unit. The first group, Acquisition of Letters, contains his notes on antiquarian catalogs, indexes he compiled of 19th century Methodist periodicals, and back issues of Sotheby catalogs, dating to the early 20th century, in which Wesley letters were offered for sale. Correspondence is composed of two types of materials: his contact with other Wesleyan scholars; and the hundreds of inquiries he made to international archives in the mid-1970s  about their holding of Wesley manuscripts (the letters shown here are mainly replies in the negative).</p>
<p>Folders grouped under Identification comprise files about letters with either questionable dating or attribution, but also many details about the physical characteristics of letters that help in their proper identification, such as franks, seals, watermarks, and how to identify not only Wesley's handwriting but that of his various scribes and amanuenses.</p>
<p>Indexes and Logs houses Baker's and other scholars' work on listing and categorizing Wesley's voluminous letters.  In addition to the folders in this group, several other card files and indexes can be found in the Frank Baker Papers, Subject Files Series, Card Files Subseries, which houses over 30 indexes and 40,000 cards that Baker compiled for his own use as well as that of the Project.</p>
<p>Following Indexes and Logs are several folder groups of reproductions of thousands of Wesley letters, both outgoing and incoming, compiled from various sources and organized in various ways: Letters from Printed Sources, Letters by Archive, Letters by Correspondent, and Letters by Chronology.</p>
<p>The last three groups contain photocopies and microfilm printouts of hundreds of manuscript letters from and to JW, many of which have not yet appeared in printed form. There are far too many to cite here individually, but some of these are noted in the finding aid, with preference being given to those more difficult to access, such as those from smaller archives and those that have never been published in either the Telford or Abingdon editions of the Wesley's letters.</p> </scopecontent>

<scopecontent> <p>Arranged in four subseries: <emph render="bold">General Planning; Printers and Printing; Stemmata and Texts;</emph> and <emph render="bold">Typescripts</emph>. Because his work on the "Descriptive and Analytical Bibliography" required Baker to consult so many thousands of editions of works by John and Charles Wesley, this series has an extremely complex relationship not only with other series in the current collection but also with other collections at Duke. The outline provided below is not exhaustive in explicating these relationships, but does provide guidance about when to expect to find related materials at Duke, and where to search. Frank Baker was the original unit editor for Volumes 33 and 34, and authored almost all the original material in this series, the bulk of which dates to the 1970s and 1980s. Today the unit editors are Page Thomas and Richard P. Heitzenrater.</p>

<p>For a general overview of all the Frank Baker collections at Duke, see <emph render="bold">Related Materials</emph> earlier in this inventory. To access all pertinent information at Duke on particular publications by JW, see also the following series/subseries and collections as applicable:
<list type="simple">
<item>For initial  bibliographic information on a particular title, see both the <emph render="bold">Stemmata and Texts Subseries</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Typescripts Subseries</emph> in the current series. In addition, further information can often be found in the Series/Subseries corresponding to the volume in which the title appeared (or is planned to appear). As an extreme but instructive example, all of the following materials can be found about the single sermon <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Awake, Thou That Sleepest</title>: a 23-page essay and stemma in the Typescripts Subseries below: an additional folder of notes and rough drafts in the Stemmata and Texts subseries; and more notes, including photocopies of over fifty editions from libraries around the world, in the  <ref target="s1" linktype="simple"><emph render="bold"><title render="italic" linktype="simple">Sermons</title> Series,</emph></ref> <emph render="bold">Stemmata Subseries.</emph></item>

<scopecontent><p>Contains Baker's research on individual publication histories of the first 94 works to be listed in the <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph>, plus various work on scattered higher-numbered entries. Most folders contain photocopies of multiple editions of these works, Baker's drafts and notes for the individual publication history of the work, and an outline of the stemma. In theory, Baker's writing and notes here should match the more polished versions to be found in the full 1981 typescript to be found in the next subseries; in practice, though, no comparison has been made, so there are likely to be handwritten notes here that are not included in the fair copy typescript.
For this subseries, due to the high proportion of partial and full photocopies and transcribed materials, the dates in the box list reflect only the initial publication dates that Baker cited for each work. Although no attempt has been made to include dates of all items in each folder, in most cases it can be assumed that materials photocopied from later 18th century editions are included--gathering such editions for evaluation was the point of the research. Baker's own writing and notes are almost all undated, but it the bulk of this work was done by the early 1980s. Arranged in order of the new numbering scheme assigned by Baker for the <emph render="italic">Bibliography</emph>; the equivalent older number, based on the earlier bibliographies of Baker and Richard Green, is indicated in parentheses. Researchers should note that while this list stops at item 94, short of the 106 in the full typescript in the next folder group, it also picks up again with miscellaneous manuscripts for handful of citations above 106.</p> </scopecontent>

<scopecontent><p>This subseries contains the most complete version Baker left of the two-volume bibliography for the <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Bicentennial Edition</title>. The core of this version is a draft he completed in 1981 and distributed to other project editors and scholars. More than  700 pages long, this manuscript contained Baker's essays and stemma for  the first 106 titles in the Wesley bibliography (out of approximately 800 intended entries). To this version he added corrections and updated pages at various points in the 1980s and early 1990s. He then sent the 1991 version to the libraries of several universities participating in the WWEP (Drew, Emory, SMU, and Duke). This draft does not exactly match the list of individually foldered texts and stemma in the previous subseries. That list stops earlier, at item 94, but also picks up again with scattered higher-numbered entries in the bibliography.</p></scopecontent>
