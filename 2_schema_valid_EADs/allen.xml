         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Gay Wilson Allen Papers span the years 1801 to 1988, but the bulk
		  of the collection occurs during the years 1925 to the 1970s. They consist of
		  correspondence, notebooks, printed material, essays and other writings,
		  literary manuscripts, scrapbooks, teaching materials, pictures, books,
		  clippings, offprints, periodicals, and sale catalogs. The focus of the
		  collection is Allen's career as a university professor and Walt Whitman
		  scholar. In particular Allen's activities as a professor at New York University
		  and as a lecturer at Nagono, Japan in 1955, are documented. The history of
		  Whitman criticism is an important theme. There is a large amount of research
		  material on Whitman, both of Allen and other literary scholars. These include
		  Evie Allison Allen, Clara Barrus, Charles N. Elliot, Clifton Joseph Furness,
		  Emory Holloway, Peter Mitilineos, Hans Reisiger, and Henry Scholey Saunders.
		  The Correspondence Series contains original correspondence acquired by Allen of
		  Richard Watson Gilder, Alice James, and William James. This series also
		  contains the correspondence of Roger Asselineau, Fredson Bowers, Oscar Cargill,
		  Malcolm Cowley, Charles E. Feinberg, Milton Hindus, Emory Holloway, Sholom
		  Kahn, and Frederik Schyberg. There are no strictly personal papers in the
		  collection.</p>
         <p>Allen's career, both as a professor and Whitman scholar, is documented
		  in several series. The Walt Whitman Materials Series and the Scrapbooks Series
		  relate to his Whitman research. In the former series the Commemorations and
		  Societies Subseries and the Popular Culture Subseries also document the ever
		  increasing interest in Whitman's life and works during the twentieth century.
		  The Correspondence Subseries and the Pictures Subseries contain copies of
		  letters and pictures relating to Whitman and his age. The Correspondence Series
		  also contains extensive letters concerning Allen's early teaching career, his
		  dealings with several presses, and the marketing and reception of his
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href=""> The Solitary Singer, a Whitman biography.</title>
         </p>
         <p>The papers of six Whitman scholars are in the Walt Whitman Scholars
		  Series. It suggests the international range both of Whitman scholarship and of
		  Allen's interests. In addition to the interest in Whitman she shared with her
		  husband, Evie Allison Allen was also a skilled translator of Germanic
		  languages. Charles N. Elliot and Emory Holloway, as well as Canadian Henry
		  Scholey Saunders, were Whitman collector-scholars who interacted with both
		  Allen and Furness. The late Peter Mitilineos was one of Allen's students and
		  was particularly interested in the writings of Italian Whitman scholar Pasquale
		  Jannacone. Professor and Mrs. Allen both had an interest in the writings of
		  German Whitman scholar Hans Reisiger.</p>
         <p>The Clifton Joseph Furness Papers Series documents the history of
		  Whitman criticism from Whitman's day to the start of Allen's biography of
		  Whitman,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Solitary Singer.</title> Allen used some of
		Furness's research materials to write the book. The Clara Barrus Papers
		Subseries contains her research materials on the relationship between Whitman
		and John Burroughs. In fact Barrus was a close friend of Whitman's friends
		Burroughs and Thomas Biggs Harned. The subseries includes portions of Barrus's
		correspondence, her research materials, and the manuscript of her study of
		Whitman and Burroughs, entitled
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Whitman and Burroughs, Comrades.</title> The
		Correspondence Subseries contains correspondence with a number of Whitman
		friends, scholars, and collectors. The Writings Subseries chiefly reflects the
		results of the information Furness collected on Whitman during the 1930s and
		1940s. Furness began three major Whitman projects: a definitive biography, an
		extensive bibliography, and a study of his reception in New England,
		tentatively entitled
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Bull in the China Shop.</title> None of
		these works were published during Furness's lifetime.</p>
         <p>Collections in the Duke University. David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library related to the Gay Wilson Allen Papers include the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">American Literature</title> Papers and the Trent
		Collection. Collections at other institutions related to the Gay Wilson Allen
		Papers include papers of Clara Barrus and Emory Holloway at the University of
		Virginia, papers of Henry Scholey Saunders at Brown University, and papers of
		Charles N. Elliot at the Library of Congress.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Provenance Note on the Clifton Joseph Furness Papers Series</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Gay Wilson Allen acquired Clifton Joseph Furness's papers in 1948, but
		  Furness had acquired some of Clara Barrus's papers shortly before her death in
		  1931. In turn Barrus, in her role as the literary executor of John Burroughs,
		  had acquired some of Burroughs's papers in the years before his death in 1921.
		  Apparently, Barrus had originally planned to write an extensive study of
		  Whitman and his followers, based on materials found in her Research Files, but
		  she apparently later decided to narrow its focus to a study of the relationship
		  between Whitman and Burroughs. During Burroughs's last years she retyped some
		  of his correspondence with Whitman and related figures, and in her own hand
		  transcribed Burroughs's comments on each letter. With the help of Furness,
		  Barrus published her last book,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Whitman and Burroughs, Comrades</title> in 1931.
		About that time, Furness acquired the materials found in the Clara Barrus
		Papers Subseries.</p>
         <p>Furness was in close contact with other Whitman friends, scholars, and
		  collectors, and spent years collecting information on Whitman. None of these
		  projects were published during his lifetime.</p>
         <p>In 1948, New York University professor Gay Wilson Allen was able to
		  persuade the university to purchase for his use Furness's papers, which by now
		  included papers from Barrus and Burroughs as well. David Goodale and Henry
		  Scholey Saunders agreed to cooperate with Allen in the publication of Furness's
		  Whitman bibliography. In about l951 Allen acquired Saunders's revised copy of
		  the portion of Furness's Whitman bibliography concerned with
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Biography and Criticism,</title> Part 6 (of
