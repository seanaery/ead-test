         <p>Americans for Immigrant Justice (formerly Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC)) is a not-for-profit legal assistance organization dedicated to protecting and promoting the basic human rights of immigrants of all nationalities. </p>
         <p>Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC) was founded in 1996 because of pending restrictions and funding cuts to Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funded agencies, which prevented many organizations in the state of Florida from serving the immigrant population. Sweeping changes in immigration law and welfare reform also increased the demand for services from FIAC. In 2011 After 15 years of helping immigrants obtain legal status, successfully litigating their unjust treatment and pressing for constructive immigration laws and policy, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC)
became Americans for Immigrant Justice (AI Justice for short and Americanos Pro Justicia Inmigrante in Spanish)to better reflect the national focus and depth of their work.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Americans for Immigrant Justice (AIJ) records, formerly the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC), span the years of 1980-2011. This collection contains extensive documentation of the events and crises surrounding asylum, deportation, detention and abuses that took place within Florida detention centers from the years 1980 to 2011, as well as documentation regarding issues of repatriation. It records the efforts of FIAC to advocate on behalf of immigrant and refugee populations in Florida during this time. The majority of material in this collection deals with Haitians seeking asylum in the U.S., but also includes material on Cuban refugees. Many files focus on Cheryl Little's work with child refugees and detainees and their asylum claims, and on discrimination against female immigrants. Files also include material on interdiction at sea and related court documents, government immigration policy pre- and post-9/11, documentation on hunger strikes at various facilities, material related to the Haitian Boat crises, and documentation of raids on immigrant populations. The detention facilities of particular concern in this collection include Guantanamo, Krome, and Turner Guilford Knight correctional facilities, as well as Florida's county jails.</p>
         <p>The collection contains legal documents related to the activity of FIAC, including affidavits of detainees held in Florida facilities, and other court documents, such as court pleadings and briefings; reports on facility conditions; correspondence, including correspondence between detainees and their families, letters from concerned citizens, and formal correspondence between FIAC, especially Cheryl Little, and other organizations and officials; case studies and reports on immigration and refugee crises, and reports of abuses and conditions in Florida detention facilities; FBI interviews with detainees; related articles and speeches; restricted material, including medical records; and promotional and educational videos produced by or for FIAC, documentary footage of missions and events, and press conference and news footage.</p>
         <p>The series in this collection include the <emph render="bold">Detention Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Immigrant and Refugees Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Legal Files Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">General Organizational Records Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph>.
