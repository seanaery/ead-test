         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The professional papers of William Baumol are representative of his
		  career as an academic economist and consultant to industry and government. The
		  collection dates from his appointment to the Department of
		  Economics, Princeton University in 1949 until his retirement in 1992 and covers
		  nearly all of his research interests. Some earlier material (1940s) includes notebooks from the London School of Economics (LSE) and papers prepared for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The
		  bulk of the collection dates from 1950 to 1970 and 1975 to 1990. Materials take the form of correspondence with other economists concerning publications or works in progress; manuscript drafts and galleys; papers prepared for conferences and special lectures; research materials (including notes, materials produced by
		  others, data and other statistical output); special project reports, including
		  grant proposals; teaching materials (lecture notes, exams, course syllabi);
		  material relating to industry consulting work, legal testimony and some printed
		  material.</p>
         <p>The contents of the collection display Baumol's diverse interests as
		  an economist. Early material is concerned mainly with dynamic systems and their
		  mathematical expression as well as welfare economics and externalities. His
		  work (with his undergraduate student and future Nobel Prize winner, G.S.
		  Becker) on Classical Monetary Theory is also represented. The outcome of
		  Baumol's role as consultant to industry (in connection with the firms Alderson
		  and Sessions, Mathematica, and Consultants in Industry Economics) is manifest
		  in his work on the behavior of firms and industry structure. Reports prepared
		  for Alderson and Sessions, Mathematica, and Consultants in Industry Economics,
		  as well as drafts of papers relating the business activities of firms to
		  economic theory, including his work on the "sales maximization hypothesis," are
		  contained within the collection.</p>
         <p>Other subjects include fairness theory, environmental economics, and the development of his "cost disease model" and "unbalanced growth model" which attempt to explain the fiscal problems of the
		  performing arts, educational systems, etc. Much of his work on the finances of
		  the performing arts was undertaken with his wife, Hilda Baumol. In addition,
		  the collection contains material related to his professional involvement with
		  the American Economic Association, the Eastern Economic Association, the
		  Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, and the American
		  Association of University Professors. The collection also contains legal
		  testimony and reports prepared as an expert witness in antitrust cases before
		  the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory
		  Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, among many others.</p>
         <p>Correspondents and chief protagonists during Baumol's long career
		  represent many notable economists, including colleagues from the London School of Economics and other English economists, David Finch, Frank Hahn, Jan de van Graaf, Friederich Hayek, Sir John Hicks,
		  Nicholas Kaldor, James Meade, Dennis H. Robertson, Lord Lionel Robbins, and
		  Ralph Turvey; Nobel prize winners G.S. Becker, Milton Friedman, and Paul
		  Samuelson; other prominent twentieth century economists including Robert
		  Dorfman and Don Patinkin; Princeton colleagues Jacob Viner and Harvey
		  Leibenstein; frequent co-authors Elizabeth Bailey and Dietrich Fischer; in
		  addition to former students, Samuel Hollander and Richard Quandt. Also
		  represented are industry leaders from telecommunications, transportation, and
		  public utility sectors. Researchers should note the possibility of
		  cross-referencing with other collections included in the Economists' Papers
		  Project, for example, with the Don Patinkin Papers on the subject of Classical
		  Monetary Theory. </p>
         <p>The collection is organized into four series, some
		  of which are further divided into associated subseries: <emph render="bold">Correspondence,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Writings,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Subject Files,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Legal
		  Testimony.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> includes the
		  subseries <emph render="bold">Correspondence Alphabetical,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Subject,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Date.</emph> Researchers should note that in
		  addition to letters, other material such as drafts of papers sent to Baumol,
		  clippings, and book reviews are included within the series. The material in the
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence Alphabetical Subseries</emph> covers the
		  early part of Baumol's career, 1943-1968, with the bulk of it dating from the
		  1950s. Topics covered are representative of his early research interests or
		  those of his correspondents, who for the most part were British colleagues from
		  Baumol's graduate studies at the LSE. The researcher will find that this series
		  is a likely source for viewing the development and formulation of Baumol's
		  ideas as well as his comments on the theories of others. The most substantive
		  correspondence (with more than twenty letters exchanged for each) is between
		  Gary Becker, Robert Dorfman, David Finch, Jan de v. Graaf, Frank Hahn, Don
		  Patinkin, and Paul Samuelson. Much of the correspondence contains copies of
		  both letters to and from Baumol, although there are exceptions to this,
		  particularly for the earlier letters. The last two subseries,
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Subject</emph> and <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Date,</emph> overlap somewhat in terms of the
		  period covered (1952-1984 for the first, and 1974-1990 for the second). The
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Subject Subseries</emph> deals mostly
		  with Baumol's professional activities with the American Economic Association
		  and his other professional activities, including tenure reviews and other
		  recommendations, with notable exceptions in correspondence files for
		  Areeda-Turner (on predatory pricing), Samuelson-Dorfman (on Marx), and
		  Hollander (on Classical economics). Because of the sensitive nature of some
		  materials in the <emph render="bold">Subject Subseries,</emph> researchers
		  using them must sign a release form provided by Research Services staff. The
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Date Subseries</emph> covers a variety of
		  topics but deals mostly with requests for papers or with the details of various
		  engagements.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> includes drafts, galley
		  proofs, handwritten notes, correspondence relating to publisher's contracts,
		  and final versions of many of Baumol's published writings, as well as some
		  unpublished and working papers. While the collection does not contain a
		  complete set of Baumol's hundreds of publications, the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> is representative of his diverse research
		  interests and his prolific writing ability. In an effort to preserve the
		  original organization of the Baumol papers, this series is chronological as
		  opposed to organized by subject. Hence, the researcher interested in
		  constructing the process of Baumol's contributions to the theory of, say,
		  Industry Structure, would be advised to consult the <emph render="bold">Subject
		  Series</emph> for teaching materials or research files and the
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> for a more complete picture.
		  </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> is organized into
		  the following subseries: <emph render="bold">Project Files,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Research
		  Files.</emph> The <emph render="bold">Project Files Subseries</emph> is
		  arranged by subject and includes reports prepared for industry consulting to
		  firms such as Southern Railways (1963-65), General Foods (1963) and Morgan
		  Stanley (1963-64); projects on Fairness, Scale Economies, and the Performing
		  Arts; and testimony prepared for government Senate and House of Representatives
		  subcommittees. The bulk of the material is from 1975-1985. The
		  <emph render="bold">Teaching Material Subseries</emph> includes four undated
		  notebooks from Baumol's student days, lecture notes on Dynamics and Welfare
		  Theory (the notes which formed the basis for his first published book and his
		  Ph.D. thesis) and a copy of Lord Robbins' lecture on Classical Economics. The
		  <emph render="bold">Research Files Subseries</emph> is organized by subject:
		  History of Economics, Industrial Organization, Fairness,
		  Productivity/Entrepreneurship, and General.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">The Legal Testimony Series</emph> contains
		  voluminous records of legal proceedings in which Baumol played a key role as a
		  consultant or witness. The series is organized by the regulatory or legal body
		  involved in legal proceedings: <emph render="bold">Civil Actions
		  Subseries,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Federal Communications Commission
		  Subseries,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
		  Subseries,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Federal Trade Commission
		  Subseries,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Interstate Commerce Commission
		  Subseries,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Public Utilities Subseries,</emph>
            <emph render="bold">Tax Court Subseries,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous.</emph> The material within each subseries is
		  arranged chronologically. There are restricted materials in this series.
		  Some of the materials are clearly marked as attorney-client privileged
		  information (where the client is a major firm) or sealed by the court in
		  question. It is impossible, without going through every item, to ensure an
		  exhaustive list of material that might compromise certain industry secrets or
		  other privileged information; therefore, the researcher using this series must
		  sign a release form provided by the reference staff.</p>
         <arrangement>
            <p>PROCESSING NOTE: The materials received by Duke University arrived
			 from Professor Baumol's offices at Princeton, New York University, and from his
			 private residence. These were treated as one single accession and the materials
			 from all three shipments have been consolidated. Hence, while the original
			 organization has been mostly preserved at the folder level, at the box level
			 this is not the case. Wherever possible the original folder labels were used in
			 organizing the collection. Notable exceptions to this are the material in the
			 <emph render="bold">Legal Testimony Series</emph> and the performing arts,
			 government projects, and industry consulting folders in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> as the bulk of this material was
			 received loose.</p>
         </arrangement>
         <p>The addition to the collection (2001-0169)(11,825 items, 19.20 linear feet, dated
		  1964-1995 and undated) contains professional papers including correspondence,
		  reviews, consulting files, lecture notes, drafts of writings, grant files, and
		  three black-and-white transparencies. Revisions of Baumol's writings on
		  productivity and his books
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Economics: Principles and Policy</title> and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Productivity and American Leadership: The Long
		  View</title> are represented among the drafts. </p>
         <p>The addition to the collection (2001-0170)(2000 items, 5 linear feet, dated
		  1974-1990) holds files containing or regarding reviews, recommendations,
		  proposals, engagements, and other correspondence. Subjects include the World
		  Resources Institute, the Eastern Economic Association, and the manuscript of
		  <emph render="doublequote">On Finances of the Performing Arts during
		  Stagflation.</emph> There are also 114 floppy disks of graphs and texts for
		  writings by Baumol as well as one reel-to-reel audiotape. </p>
