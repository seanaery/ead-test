         <p>The Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University was established for the study of the documentary process. <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Indivisible: Stories of American Community</title> was a national documentary project which took place primarily during 1999-2001, and was sponsored by the Center for Documentary Studies in partnership with the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. The project captured the experiences of individuals participating in grassroots community organizations and activism in twelve American communities at the end of the 20th century.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The records of the documentary project <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Indivisible: Stories of American Community</title> span the dates 1988-2002, with the bulk of the collection dating from 1999 to 2002, the primary timeframe for the project. Through documentary photographs and oral histories, project records, videos, and other materials, the collection documents the social conditions in twelve American communities as well as the history of the project, which explored civil activism, struggle, and change in the following locations: the North Pacific Coast of Alaska; Ithaca, N.Y.; San Francisco, California; Navajo Nation, Arizona and New Mexico; Eau Claire, South Carolina; Delray Beach, Florida; Western North Carolina; Stony Brook, N.Y.; San Juan, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the Yaak Valley, Montana. Each project is fully described in its entry in this collection guide.  The project co-directors were Tom Rankin of the Center for Documentary Studies and Trudy Wilner Stack of the Center for Creative Photography. The project was also supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the NEA, and other agencies.</p>
         <p>The photographs in this collection, most of formed part of a traveling exhibit, were taken chiefly during 1999 by twelve well-known documentary and landscape photographers working in partnership with project oral history interviewers. The photographers are Dawoud Bey, Bill Burke, Debbie Fleming Caffery, Lucy Capehart, Lynn Davis, Terry Evans, Lauren Greenfield, Joan Liftin, Reagan Louie, Danny Lyon, Sylvia Plachy, and Eli Reed.  Their images capture the experiences of individuals participating in grassroots initiatives addressing American social issues such as housing, immigration (in particular, Haitians in Florida), the natural environment, race relations, youth empowerment, and economic and cultural development, and others.</p>
         <p>Also preserved in this collection are detailed oral histories recorded in each community, with audio recordings and transcriptions; information on the traveling exhibit; and materials on other project outcomes, including a hardbound large-format book of the images, a postcard exhibit, a guide for educators, booklets and other publications on community organizing, and radio and television programs. Other files document the establishment of research archives based on the documentary project's output, at Duke, in Arizona, and in each of the twelve communities.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged into two series: <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">Project Files</ref> and <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">Photographs</ref>. The first houses the interview records, including digital and analog cassette tapes of oral histories, as well as tape lists, logs, and transcripts in both paper and digital formats, and the project files described above. The second series houses the photographic prints, most of which were part of the traveling exhibition and the book. Additional supporting materials found in the Project Files Series include postcards and videocassette tapes from exhibits; a CD-ROM of the 2001 website; field notes in paper and digital format; and other office files generated by the project and its staff, including Tom Rankin, one of the project co-directors. There are also slides of the  and biographies of the photographers.  Three hundred thirty-nine of the electronic transcripts have been migrated to the electronic records server. A disk directories log and use copies exist. Please contact Research Services staff before coming to use this collection.</p>

Ayana and her friend joke about the boys who sell "copa," the name of a hair gel product the girls use as a code word for crack. Bay View is the poorest neighborhood in San Francisco and Mamie Matthews has always been very active in the community. The drug dealers know Mamie and her family and, out of respect, do not loiter directly in front of her building.</p>
