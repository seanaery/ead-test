         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of 
		  <persname>Angier Biddle Duke</persname> span the years 1915 to 1995,
		  though the bulk of the collection ranges from 1940 to 1995. The papers chiefly
		  consist of correspondence; scrapbooks; diaries; photographs; diplomatic papers;
		  sound recordings, video cassette tapes and films; appointment books; clippings;
		  printed material; and business papers. There are also a few legal and financial
		  papers. Miscellaneous materials also include writings by other authors; fiscal
		  and other reports; school grade reports; invitations; guest lists; and some
		  memorabilia. The collection documents Angier Biddle Duke's long career in 
		  <subject>politics and diplomacy</subject>, as well as his activities as
		  chairman or president of various agencies and institutions. Much of the
		  material also documents Duke's personal life as well as the social and
		  political activities of various family members. The subjects represented in
		  greatest detail include 
		  <subject>U.S. politics</subject> and 
		  <subject>foreign policy</subject>; the 
		  <subject>Kennedy and Johnson administrations</subject>; and the history
		  of US. and foreign diplomacy. In addition, the papers contain valuable
		  information on economic and social conditions in 
		  <geogname>Spain</geogname>, 
		  <geogname>Morocco</geogname>, 
		  <geogname>Denmark</geogname>, 
		  <geogname>Africa</geogname>, 
		  <geogname>Pakistan</geogname>, and other countries; 
		  <subject>World War II</subject>; 
		  <subject>post-World War Europe</subject>; European and Pakistani 
		  <subject>refugees</subject>; 
		  <subject>civil rights</subject> and 
		  <subject>de-segregation</subject> (especially in 
		  <geogname>Washington, DC</geogname>); 
		  <subject>philanthropy</subject>; 
		  <geogname>Long Island</geogname> social life and communities; and the 
		  <famname>Duke</famname>, 
		  <famname>Biddle</famname>, and 
		  <famname>Drexel</famname> families.</p>
         <p>Details on Angier Biddle Duke's life as well as information on the
		  Duke, Biddle, and Drexel families can be found in the <emph render="bold">Biographical Data Series</emph>. These materials include some of
		  A. B. Duke's military records; articles on A. B. Duke; biographical entries on
		  A. B. Duke from 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Who's Who</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Biography Today</title>; "in memoriam" booklets
		from his first wife's funeral and the funeral of 
		<famname>Angier Buchanan Duke</famname>, A. B. Duke's father; and
		genealogical materials on the families. Selected condolences out of the
		hundreds sent to 
		<famname>Robin Chandler Duke</famname> after her husband's death in 1995
		also reveal much about the personality and life of A. B. Duke. In addition, the
		narratives in the <emph render="bold">Diaries Series</emph> offer a great deal
		of material concerning the personalities of A. B. Duke and his family and
		acquaintances throughout his life.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> also offers
		  details on the personal relations between members of the Duke, Biddle, 
		  <famname>Semans</famname>, and 
		  <famname>Trent</famname> families, though correspondence between
		  immediate family members makes up a relatively small percentage of this large
		  series. The correspondence files are therefore perhaps most useful for the
		  documentation they provide about A. B. Duke's extraordinary career and his many
		  important friends and contacts in international politics and high society.
		  Additional biographical data on A. B. Duke and family members, particularly
		  useful for information on Robin Chandler Duke's social and political
		  activities, can be found in the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>
		  files.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Pictures Series</emph> contains hundreds of
		  photographs of the Duke, Semans, and Biddle families. Some early photographs of
		  Angier Biddle Duke were taken during his enlistment in the Army from 1940-1945.
		  An album entitled "A celebration of the life of 
		  <persname>Benjamin Newton Duke</persname>, 1979" can be found in the
		  <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series</emph>. Finally, as A. B. Duke served as
		  president of the Duke Family Association of NC from 1988-1995, there are a
		  number of items related to the meetings of this genealogical association found
		  in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>Angier Biddle Duke was best known for his ambassadorial skills and his
		  political acumen beginning with his appointment to the office of Ambassador to 
		  <geogname>El Salvador</geogname> in 1952 as the youngest ambassador
		  ever appointed to a post. His subsequent career in 
		  <subject>diplomacy</subject> and politics, including his appointment as
		  
		  <subject>Chief of Protocol</subject> under Presidents Kennedy and
		  Johnson, is unusually well-documented through the <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Diaries
		  Series</emph>, containing detailed personal diaries and memoirs; the
		  <emph render="bold">Interviews Series</emph> (both taped and written); numerous
		  scrapbooks and photographs found in the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph>
		  and <emph render="bold">Pictures Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Printed
		  Materials Series</emph>, which includes many articles on A. B. Duke; and the
		  <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>. A series of written and taped
		  diaries entitled the "Ambassador's Diary" are especially interesting for A. B.
		  Duke's candid reflections on his diplomatic experiences. A few items also
		  reveal the family's experiences in foreign countries as viewed by his wife, 
		  <famname>Robin Chandler Duke</famname>, as exemplified by her brief
		  diary from 
		  <geogname>Brazil</geogname>, 
		  <geogname>Peru</geogname>, and 
		  <geogname>Bolivia</geogname> (1976). A relatively minor source of
		  information on the Dukes' itineraries include the <emph render="bold">Travel
		  Series</emph>, which contains routine documents relating to the Dukes' travel
		  activities. Other materials concerning foreign policy and diplomacy may be
		  found in the <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous Series</emph>, where many
		  articles and speeches by other authors are filed.</p>
         <p>The political and social events of the 1960s and 1970s are
		  well-represented in the A. B. Duke Papers in the multimedia formats associated
		  with the <emph render="bold">Audio, Film, and Videotape Series</emph>,
		  containing numerous 
		  <genreform>recordings</genreform>, audio and visual, of speeches,
		  toasts, and visits of foreign dignitaries; the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> and <emph render="bold">Pictures Series</emph>,
		  which hold many candid and formal photographs of well-known politicians, 
		  <subject>diplomats</subject>, celebrities, and artists, many of them
		  signed; and the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>, documenting many
		  major world events as well as personal events from 1950s to the 1990s. One
		  scrapbook covers President Kennedy's trip to Berlin, West Germany; another
		  oversize scrapbook covers an international incident at 
		  <geogname>Palomares, Spain</geogname> (1966): while Duke was that
		  country's ambassador, an undetonated US nuclear bomb was lost off the coast of 
		  <geogname>Spain</geogname>, then recovered after much consternation,
		  and increased international outcry against nuclear weapons. Materials in the
		  <emph render="bold">Protocol Papers Series</emph> also concern Kennedy's
		  assassination and the transition to a Johnson White House during the period
		  when A. B. Duke was Chief of Protocol. As 
		  <famname>Jacqueline Kennedy</famname> had already become a good friend
		  of A. B. Duke's family, there are items in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> reflecting her close relationship
		  with them in the difficult years after her husband's assassination.</p>
         <p>The head of the 
		  <corpname>State Department</corpname> Office of Protocol serves as
		  principal adviser to the President and Secretary of State on matters of
		  diplomatic procedures governed by law or international customs and practice.
		  Angier Biddle Duke's responsibilities as Chief of Protocol from 1961-65 and
		  1968, including his role in the arrangements for the 
		  <subject>Kennedy funeral</subject>, are best represented by materials
		  in the <emph render="bold">Protocol Papers Series</emph>, arranged
		  alphabetically by country, and by many valuable letters and telegrams in the
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>, and in the
		  <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series</emph>. In addition, a great
		  deal of relevant information, both contemporary and retrospective in nature,
		  can be found in the <emph render="bold">Interviews Series</emph>. Several
		  important volumes in the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> and
		  <emph render="bold">Diaries Series</emph> are also were created as records of
		  his tenure as Chief of Protocol, and the <emph render="bold">Pictures
		  Series</emph> contains many candid and formal photographs during this period.
		  Finally, events relating to the 
		  <corpname>Office of Protocol</corpname> are found in audio or film
		  format in the <emph render="bold">Audio, Film, and Video Series</emph>.
		  Memorabilia from this period such as invitations, dinner menus, guest lists,
		  and souvenir programs from inaugurations abroad can also be found in the
		  <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>A. B. Duke's extensive organizational activities in later decades are
		  documented in greatest detail through the <emph render="bold">Correspondence,
		  Subject Files, Interviews, Printed Materials, and Writings and Speeches
		  Series</emph>. A large number of materials reflect A. B. Duke's long
		  involvement in the administration of 
		  <corpname>Long Island University</corpname>, near his family residence
		  in Southampton, N.Y., as well as in other institutions such as the 
		  <corpname>International Rescue Commission</corpname>, various
		  Democratic committees, 
		  <corpname>CARE</corpname>, the NYC Dept. of Civic Affairs and Public
		  Events, the 
		  <corpname>Spanish Institute</corpname>, the 
		  <corpname>Appeal to Conscience Foundation</corpname>, the 
		  <corpname>Japan-American Institute</corpname>, the 
		  <corpname>World Affairs Council</corpname>, and the 
		  <corpname>American Council of Ambassadors</corpname>, and many others
		  with whom he was affiliated for shorter periods of time. The
		  <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> and other series also illustrate A. B.
		  Duke's later involvement in organizations attempting to establish more
		  democratic structures in countries such as 
		  <geogname>El Salvador</geogname>, 
		  <geogname>Nicaragua</geogname>, and 
		  <geogname>Guyana</geogname>. Some materials also reflect Robin Chandler
		  Duke's later involvement in politics, including her unsuccessful bid for the
		  Democratic nomination to fill Koch's congressional seat in 1978, and her role
		  as chairwoman of 
		  <corpname>Population Action International</corpname>.</p>
         <p>Although they contain relatively few documents, the
		  <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial Papers</emph> do provide some
		  information on A. B. Duke's income and financial activities, and the 
		  <subject>Doris Duke Trust</subject>; also in the legal papers is a
		  publisher's contract for the biography of 
		  <persname>Doris Duke</persname> and a copy of Angier Buchanan Duke's will. Other legal and financial matters
		  related to the 
		  <famname>Duke and Biddle families</famname>, particularly the Doris
		  Duke estate (1995) are referred to on a regular basis in the
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>. Very little is to be found in
		  the collection on the administration, maintenance, or acquisition of Angier
		  Biddle Duke's residences in Washington, NYC, or Long Island, though some
		  illustrations of residences can be found in the <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph> and <emph render="bold">Pictures
		  Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>Collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library which contain information relevant to the Angier Biddle Duke Papers
		  include the James Buchanan Duke Papers and especially the Semans Family Papers.
		  The Duke University Living History Program collection, also in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, contains an interview with Angier
		  Biddle Duke recorded in the 1970s.</p>
