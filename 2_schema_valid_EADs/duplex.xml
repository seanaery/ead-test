            <p>The collection arrived largely arranged according to format, ranging
			 from photographs, negatives, slides to printed materials. The photographs were
			 arranged in two ways: 1) alphabetically (for the most part) by client, and 2)
			 by product type. The majority of negatives were already sleeved and labeled,
			 and are listed in the box list. There were a number of negatives in their
			 original paper sleeves, or loose in envelopes. These items were placed in paper
			 negative sleeves and labeled as best they could be. The slides were organized
			 by varying topic: some are categorized by product/client name (Budweiser, Coke,
			 etc.); while some are arranged by product type (automobiles); and some are
			 under other categories including Construction and Miscellaneous. These various
			 organizational models were retained in processing of the slides. The printed
			 material was simply placed in folders and labeled.</p>

		  University where he received a BBA in Advertising and an MBA. He began his
		  career in outdoor advertising at San-Tex Advertising, in San Angelo, Tex. From
		  there, Miller founded and worked with the Duplex Advertising Company in Austin,
		  Duplex Electric Signs, and Duplex Advertising Company in Temple, Tex. He also
		  taught courses in economics, advertising, marketing, and statistics. One of his

         <p>
            <emph render="bold">The Duplex Advertising Company. Billboard Images
		  and Records</emph> spans the period 1964-1993 and documents the outdoor
		  advertising work of this company in the central Texas area, primarily through
		  photographs, negatives and slides of billboards. Many of the images are in
		  color. A large number of the images are of national campaigns advertised in
		  central Texas, as well as billboards, signs and posters of local Texas business
		  services. In addition, a handful of articles written by R. V. Miller, Jr. for a
		  number of publications, as well as other printed material and miscellaneous
		  items from the Duplex Advertising Company, are present. Some of these articles,
		  along with the images themselves, provide examples of commercial art and design
		  in the outdoor advertising arena. The collection includes outdoor advertising
		  images from national clients such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, Chevrolet, Coca
		  Cola, Coors, Wendy's, Hardee's, and Taco Bell, and Texas clients such as Lone
		  Star and Pearl beers. </p>
         <p>Related materials may be found in other outdoor advertising
		  collections, including the Outdoor Advertising Association of America Archives,
		  the Garrett Orr Papers, the Howard Scott Papers, the John Paver Papers, the
		  John E. Browning Papers, the R.C. Maxwell Co. Records, and the Strobridge
		  Collection.</p>
