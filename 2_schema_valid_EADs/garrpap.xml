         <p>The papers of George P. Garrett span the years 1929 to 2000 with the bulk of the material being dated between 1960 and 1990. The papers were initially collected and assembled by author, bibliographer, and publisher Stuart T. Wright. Wright published a number of Garrett's works at his Palaemon Press and also assembled the Stuart Wright Bibliographic Collection of George Garrett (see related materials held by the Rubenstein Library). Additional materials were received by the Library directly from George Garrett.</p>
         <p>The collection primarily documents Garrett's literary
		  career as an author of novels, short stories, poetry, and
		  dramatic works (including filmscripts) and the tremendous
		  influence he had as an English professor and an editor on
		  an entire generation of writers, particularly in the South.
		  Correspondence with numerous authors, publishers, and
		  educators offers much information about the history of
		  20th-century Southern literature, publishing, and literary
		  education. The collection is divided into the Writings
		  Series (with subseries of Writings by Garrett, Writings
		  Edited by Garrett, Writings by Others, and Proofs); the
		  Correspondence Series (with 5 subseries of alphabetically
		  and chronologically arranged correspondence); the
		  Audiovisual Material Series; and the Miscellaneous Papers
		  Series.</p>
         <p>The Alphabetical Correspondence Subseries: Group A
		  contains letters from numerous contemporary American
		  authors, among them Madison Smartt Bell, who wrote
		  regarding the progress of his fiction, his experience with
		  publishers and literary agents, and his interview with
		  Garrett for
