         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of Peter Gilow, former advertising executive of the J.
		  Walter Thompson Company, span the years 1960 to 1978, with the bulk of the
		  material dating from 1962 to 1977. The papers document the development of the
		  J. Walter Thompson Company's Frankfurt Office (J. Walter Thompson GmbH).
		  Specifically covered are the developments in and transformation of German
		  advertising since the end of World War II in television, radio, and print, the
		  emergence of a European Market, attempts to coordinate efforts among all JWT
		  European offices, and the establishment of public service advertising and
		  organizations that represent advertising agencies in Germany. The papers
		  consist of correspondence, telexes, memoranda, notes, reports, charts, scripts,
		  clippings, and printed materials. Clients of the company represented in the
		  collection include Brinkmann, Burger King, DeBeers, Dunlop, Findus, Ford,
		  Intercontinental Hotels Corp., Kraft, Kellogg, Lever-Sunlicht, Maggi, Nestle,
		  Pan American Airways, Warner-Lambert, and others. Correspondents include
		  clients and executives from other JWT offices such as David Campbell-Harris,
		  Constance B. Ivie, Don Johnston, Denis Lanigan, Jens von Leutzendorff, René
		  Müller, Dan Seymour, Alex Späth, Thomas Sutton, Neil Walker, and Edward G.
		  Wilson. Other correspondents are affiliated with Benton and Bowles, Franz
		  Burda, Deltakos Division, GWA, Harbridge House Europe, Hax-Arbeitskreis,
		  Heumann Werbegesellschaft, Managers' Meeting, Marketing Club, and Young and
		  Rubicam. Approximately half of the collection is in English and the remainder
		  is in German. The German language predominates in the Correspondence Series,
		  the Organizations Series, the Memoranda Series, and the Account Poll Series;
		  however, the English language predominates in the Other JWT Offices Series, the
		  Meetings Series, the Annual Management Series, and the Manager's Monthly
		  Assessment Series.</p>
         <p>The History Series consists of four typescripts prepared and used in
		  the solicitation of new business. These manuscripts provide an overview of the
		  Frankfurt Office. They contain information on JWT's working philosophy, the
		  Thompson system, training of employees, the group system, and JWT's
		  international cooperation. </p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series documents the early days of the JWT
		  Frankfurt Office. It contains information on the acquisition of major accounts
		  such as Kraft and Ford, materials on the purpose of the GWA (Gesellschaft
		  Werbeagenturen), the German equivalent of the American Association of
		  Advertising Agencies, and materials such as the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Tarrytown transcript</title> that provide a
		glimpse of the agency's relationships with the German government and discusses
		the ethics that need to be observed by advertising agencies in Germany in order
		to remain a competitor for government assignments (1972). Also in 1972, Peter
		Gilow reported in detail on the Managers' Meeting in London about social
		legislation in Germany and its effects on the advertising industry.
		Correspondents include persons affiliated with Benton and Bowles, Franz Burda,
		Deltakos Division, GWA, Harbridge House Europe, Hax-Arbeitskreis, Heumann
		Werbegesellschaft, Managers' Meeting, Marketing Club, and Young and Rubicam.
		</p>
         <p>The Other J. Walter Thompson Offices Series is comprised primarily of
		  correspondence between Peter Gilow and the heads of the J. Walter Thompson
		  Company's international offices. The majority of Items relate to the offices in
		  London, Milan, New York, Stockholm, Vienna and Zurich. The communication with
		  New York provides general insight into JWT-policies on research and product
		  development and in particular the ups and downs of Frankfurt's business. The
		  correspondence with the London Office reflects its function as the coordinator
		  of all European JWT offices, and provides an exchange of memoranda and reports
		  about account gains and losses, issues with international clients, new business
		  campaigns, changes in personnel, and developments in legal and financial
		  conditions of several European countries. As Chairman and CEO of the German
		  speaking area, Gilow was involved in all major developments concerning clients,
		  finances, and staff in JWT's Vienna and Zurich offices. Gilow's correspondence
		  with Vienna and Zurich documents the difficulties in establishing new
		  advertising offices in the highly competitive market of the German speaking
		  area. Correspondents include David Campbell-Harris (Milan), Constance B. Ivie
		  (New York), Don Johnston (London and New York), Denis Lanigan (London), Jens
		  von Leutzendorff (Vienna), René Müller (Zurich), Dan Seymour (New York), Alex
		  Späth (Vienna), Thomas Sutton (New York and Zurich), Neil Walker (London), and
		  Edward G. Wilson (New York). Major clients represented include Braun, Ford,
		  Gillette, Jacobs Kaffee, Kelloggs, Kraft, Longines, Nestlé, Pepsi Cola,
		  Unilever, and Wrigley.</p>
         <p>The Clients Series documents JWT's day-to-day work for its clients;
		  the development of campaigns and the production of advertisements; campaign
		  presentations; and marketing schemes used by JWT. Clients include Brinkmann,
		  Burroughs, Dunlop, Findus, Ford, Kellogg, Kraft, Maggi/Nestle, Nicolaus, Pan
		  Am, Sunlicht, Triumph, Wick, and Williams. Especially well documented is
		  JWT-Frankfurt's relationship with Ford. After representing Ford for 13 years,
		  JWT Frankfurt lost the account in 1967 to a small Swiss advertising firm. The
		  collected material includes a large number of newspaper clippings that trace
		  the response in the public media and advertising industry to the Ford decision
		  and provide insight into the overall position and reputation of JWT in Germany.
		  The continuing correspondence with this former client shows JWT-Frankfurt's
		  efforts that led to regaining the Ford account in 1969. </p>
         <p>The New Business Series provides insight into JWT-Frankfurt's efforts
		  to gain new clients or additional accounts. These materials document the
		  development and strategy for proposed campaigns from first drafts and market
		  research to the final presentation materials. It should be noted that this
		  series contains new business campaigns only for clients that they did not
		  obtain. Among the courted clients are Sektkellerei Carstens KG, Hertz, Johnson
		  Wax GmbH, Kodak, Purina, Dr. Oetker, Singer, Verband Deutscher
		  Tapetenfabrikanten, and Wrigley. </p>
         <p>The Organizations Series documents Peter Gilow's participation in
		  several advertising associations. The bulk of the material concerns Gilow's
		  work in <emph render="italic">Aktion Gemeinsinn,</emph> an organization of
		  German agencies attempting to enhance and promote the public good through
		  advertising (similar to the U.S.'s Advertising Council), and the
		  <emph render="italic">Gesellschaft Werbeagenturen</emph> (GWA). Furthermore it
		  provides some information about JWT-Frankfurt's branches, Basisresearch and JWT
		  Public Relations GmbH, and Proservice.</p>
         <p>The Meetings Series documents Peter Gilow's participation in several
		  national and international JWT committees, thus providing insight into the
		  company's structure and organization. The material of JWT's Board of Directors'
		  meetings entails the President's reports, indexes of the resolutions, material
		  for the annual meetings of stockholders (New York, February 1976), financial
		  reports, and retirement plans. Especially the meeting in February 1976 provides
		  detailed information on the JWT's European offices. The minutes of the European
		  Managers Meetings include financial reviews for Frankfurt, Stockholm, Vienna,
		  and Zurich as well as reports on political and economic trends in Germany.
		  During these meetings Gilow gave several presentations, for example on the
		  environment (London, March 1969), on the business development in the German
		  speaking area (Miami, November 1969), on the decline of advertising business in
		  Germany and organizational changes in the Vienna and Zurich offices (Berlin,
		  September 1976), and a report on political and economic trends in Germany, and
		  the financial situation of the offices in the German speaking area (London,
		  December 1976). In 1973, the International Management Group (IMG) was founded
		  to enhance the cooperation among JWT's international offices. Gilow
		  participated in the IMG as well as in the European Planning Committee (EPC)
		  from their first meetings on. It was the EPC's purpose to represent JWT's
		  European operations at IMG meetings and to provide direction to JWT's European
		  coordinating group in London.</p>
         <p>The Memoranda Series primarily documents the flow of information from
		  the executive level to the staff (Haus-Mitteilungen), and provides insight into
		  the day-to-day operations in the Frankfurt Office. Frankfurt's internal
		  communication covers such subjects as contacts with clients and the preparation
		  of campaign presentations, conferences, market research and poll results, new
		  policies on billings, labor regulations and staff appointments as well as news
		  from other JWT offices. Also included in this series are several issues of
		  JWT-Frankfurt's newsletter, the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">JWT-Frankfurt-Report.</title>
         </p>
         <p>The Writings and Speeches Series contains papers by Peter Gilow and
		  other advertising excecutives including Dan Seymour, Norman H. Strouse, Thomas
		  Sutton, and Edward G. Wilson. Topics concern marketing strategies, business
		  reports, the relationship between advertisers and advertising agencies, and JWT
		  policies on research, compensation, and new technologies. Speeches of the years
		  1957-1963 by Thomas Sutton document JWT's first thoughts about the implications
		  of the newly established European market. The same issue is followed up in
		  Gilow's writings and speeches from the 1970s. Other speeches concern the growth
		  and diversification of the German advertising scene, consumer behavior, the
		  purpose of the <emph render="italic">Aktion Gemeinsinn,</emph> Germany's social
		  legislation, and the developments of JWT-Frankfurt's business activities. </p>
         <p>The Annual Management Series contains the annual marketing plans that
		  the Frankfurt Office prepared for the New York Office. The first part of the
		  annual reports provides background information about the economic and political
		  developments in Germany during the past year, including figures for the gross
		  national product, the German advertising expenditure, and the results of
		  national elections. The report's review section gives information about the
		  agency's performance in the past year compared to the previously stated
		  objectives. In this assessment, Gilow explains why the agency could or could
		  not achieve its goals for profit, staff efficiency, acquisition of new
		  business, etc. It also notifies the New York Office about changes in
		  Frankfurt's policies for department organization, recruitment, and staff
		  training, or about the purchase of new equipment or furniture. The second part
		  sets the objectives for the next year's equivalent billings, the expected total
		  income, changes in direct and indirect salary costs, profit goals, research
		  progress, personnel, and new business. The series also contains several similar
		  assessments for the offices in London, Stockholm, Vienna, and Zurich.</p>
         <p>The Manager's Monthly Assessment Series gives detailed insight into
		  the business developments of the JWT offices in Frankfurt, Stockholm, Vienna,
		  and Zurich. In monthly reports the managers of these offices inform the New
		  York Office about the status of the year's operating results, the changes in
		  personnel and accounts, the general account status and comments about political
		  and economic developments in the respective countries. At the end of the series
		  are issues of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The European Managers Monthly Digest</title> (in
		the European Managers Assessment file) providing information on changes in
		personnel, account news, the advertising industry, office internal activities,
		and international clients from all European JWT offices. International clients
		include Bacardi, Braun, Burger King, De Beers, Ford, Gillette, Kellogg, Kodak,
		Kraft, Nestle/Findus, Pan Am, Singer, and Unilever.</p>
         <p>The Account Poll Series contains a self assessment of all the
		  advertising campaigns produced by the Frankfurt Office in 1976. The series
		  documents the complete polling process. </p>
         <p>The International Visitors and other Events Series documents the
		  planning and arrangement of visits from clients or from other JWT offices.
		  Examples of such visits are special events like Frankfurt International
		  Automobile Salon or the Photokina-Cologne. The series does not provide
		  substantial information about the events themselves but rather the Frankfurt
		  Office's preparation for such events through schedules of visitors' arrival,
		  the booking of hotels, schedules and general statements for the purpose of such
		  events. Visitors include Norman H. Strouse, Edward G. Wilson, Don Johnston, Tom
		  Sutton, Rena Bartos, and Carlos Barreto.</p>
