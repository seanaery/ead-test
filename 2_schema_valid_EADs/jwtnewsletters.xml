         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) Newsletter
		  Collection</emph> comprises the advertising agency's internally produced
		  newsletters, which date from 1916 through 2005. Included are newsletters from
		  the main office, certain domestic and international offices (particularly from
		  Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, London, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco),
		  and divisions and affiliates of JWT (especially Brouillard Communications;
		  Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein; and Thompson Recruitment Advertising). The
		  newsletters document JWT's business over the years by providing a forum for JWT
		  staff worldwide to report on their activities and on developments in the
		  advertising industry. Topics include staff biographical information; office
		  events; account and client news; featured campaigns; marketing; merchandising;
		  consumer behavior; research and planning; developments and issues in
		  television, radio, and print media; and personal activities of the staff. In
		  addition, the newsletters reflect many aspects of the corporate culture that
		  set the tone of life in JWT offices. They report events such as blood drives,
		  baseball games, office parties, staff retreats, and more. The sense of civic
		  duty that JWT tried to instill in its personnel by encouraging its staff
		  members to volunteer in their communities runs through many of the newsletters,
		  particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, often concurrent with the agency's
		  <corpname>Ad Council</corpname> and public service work.</p>
         <p>The physical form of the newsletters evolved from several stapled,
		  typewritten pages in the 1910s and early 1920s, to a (usually) four-page
		  typeset newsletter in the 1950s, to a short newsprint magazine in the 1970s, to
		  a longer glossy magazine in the 1980s. In the 1990s, some newsletters switched
		  to a fully electronic format. The entries for each newsletter in this inventory
		  detail the frequency of publication of the newsletters, the availability of
		  indexes, irregularities in volume numbering and dating, and other pertinent
		  information. Most of the newsletters are in English, but German, Spanish,
		  French, Italian and Portuguese language publications are also present.
		  Publications will be added to the collection as the archives receives and
		  processes newsletter additions.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged into three series and four indexes:
		  <emph render="bold">Main Newsletters</emph>, <emph render="bold">Domestic
		  Newsletters</emph>, and <emph render="bold">International Newsletters</emph>;
		  and an <emph render="bold">Alphabetical List of Newsletter Titles</emph>, an
		  <emph render="bold">Alphabetical List By Client of <emph render="doublequote">Campaign of the Week</emph> Articles</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">
               <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Bulletin</title> Contents by Author</emph>,
		  and <emph render="bold">
               <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Bulletin</title> Contents by
		  Title.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Main Newsletters Series</emph> holds the
		  primary house organ for the company and includes some market research results
		  as well as the opening of many international offices in 1929 and 1930.
		  Newsletter articles includes account news, client lists--or account gains and
		  losses--and biographies and short notes on JWT staff, including professional
		  accomplishments, promotions and transfers, visits to other JWT offices, and
		  personal events (i.e. marriages, births, and deaths). </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Domestic Newsletters Series</emph> is divided
		  into three subseries--<emph render="bold">Offices</emph>, <emph render="bold">Divisions</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Other
		  Newsletters</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Offices Subseries</emph> documents
		  activities in the major JWT offices in the U.S.--Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los
		  Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The office newsletters reported account
		  gains and losses, campaign updates, and other business news, with substantial
		  coverage of local events such as staff promotions and transfers, wedding and
		  birth announcements, office parties, anniversaries, company-related sports
		  events, personal and social news. They also updated local staff on news from
		  elsewhere in the agency. Many of these publications were issued regularly as
		  supplements to the main company newsletter published in New York; for instance,
		  the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">New York News,</title> at some points during
		the 1960s, was printed on the back page of the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">J. Walter Thompson Company News.</title> The
		<emph render="bold">Divisions Subseries</emph> includes newsletters from
		subsidiaries and corporate divisions such as
		<corpname>Brouillard Communications</corpname> (JWT division for
		corporate advertising and public relations),
		<corpname>Dialog </corpname>(JWT division for public relations),
		<corpname>Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein</corpname> (JWT affiliate for
		premium advertising), and
		<corpname>Thompson Recruitment Advertising</corpname> (previously named
		World Wide Agency, the JWT division for employee recruitment advertising). The
		newsletters report client gains and losses of the division and its individual
		offices, staff transfers and promotions, marriage and birth announcements, and
		other personal and social news. Some newsletters primarily address issues and
		developments pertaining to the specific aspect of advertising with which the
		division/affiliate concerns itself. The <emph render="bold">Other Newsletters
		Subseries</emph> includes publications that deal with advertising issues beyond
		a specific office's activities, along with newsletters issued by the
		Information Centers of the New York and Chicago offices that described their
		holdings or abstracted articles from newspapers and magazines relating to
		advertising. The newsletters address a broad range of issues relating to the
		advertising industry--marketing; merchandising; research; planning; consumer
		behavior; client news; major staff changes for agency executives from JWT
		offices worldwide; reports on single accounts or industries; and reports from
		the television, radio, print, and other media.</p>
         <p>Newsletters from JWT offices in Canada, Latin America, Europe,
		  Asia/Pacific, and Africa are found in the <emph render="bold">International
		  Series</emph>. Most of these newsletters report the business of the offices and
		  of the agency as a whole, noting account gains and losses, campaign results,
		  market surveys, and other developments. News of office parties and
		  anniversaries, employee transfers and promotions, staff birthdays and
		  marriages, visits from JWT executives from other offices, and other social and
		  cultural news are often included in the newsletters; for some newsletters, such
		  lighter news comprises the bulk of the information published. A few newsletters
		  cover much more specific marketing topics, such as
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Food and Drink News</title> from London and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">JWT Media Information</title> from Australia.</p>

               <p>The <emph render="bold">Main Newsletters Series</emph> comprises
				the primary house organ for the company, in all versions over time, from 1916
				through 1986, when JWT became a unit of the
				<corpname>WPP Group</corpname>. The newsletter addressed issues of
				importance to the entire company, with articles on account news, client
				lists--or account gains and losses--and biographies and short notes on JWT
				staff, including professional accomplishments, promotions and transfers, visits
				to other JWT offices, and personal events (i.e. marriages, births, and deaths).
				The series also documents the results of both general and client-specific
				market research surveys, as well as general discussions of various markets and
				industries; television, radio, and print media developments (sometimes
				including listings of programs sponsored by JWT clients); and news from and
				profiles of JWT's offices and divisions around the world. </p>
               <p>There are some gaps in publication of these newsletters, most
				notably 1931-1945 and 1970-1975. Coverage of international affairs varies
				substantially, though all of the titles in this series provide some news from
				JWT's offices overseas. The richest sources of JWT international news are the
				newsletters of the 1970s and 1980s, when there is a substantial increase in the
				frequency and depth of attention paid to JWT operations globally. See also the
				<emph render="bold">International Newsletters Series</emph>. One particularly
				useful source is
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Thumbnail Sketches,</title> a column
			 published regularly in the newsletter from 1946 to 1964 which profiled JWT
			 staff. Also common were reports on JWT advertising campaigns and their
			 subsequent impact on both the market and the client; from 1946 until roughly
			 1962, the newsletters featured the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Campaign of the Week,</title> detailing
			 particularly successful campaigns. A listing of <emph render="doublequote">Campaign of the Week</emph> topics appears at the end of
			 the finding aid.</p>
               <p>The newsletters in this series were all published by the New York
				office, sometimes with local office newsletter inserts (see the
				<emph render="bold">Domestic Newsletters Series: Offices Subseries</emph> and
				the <emph render="bold">International Newsletter Series</emph>); copies of
				advertisements or management correspondence were sometimes attached as well.
				</p>
               <p> The newsletters are organized chronologically by the date range
				of publication. Folders containing correspondence relating to newsletters

                  <p>These booklet-size serial publications share a title with the
				  earlier
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">News Bulletin</title>, but otherwise are
				different organs. They were published from 1922 to 1930 for external
				distribution, and contain articles by JWT personnel and outside contributors,
				primarily on topics of general interest to members of the advertising industry.
				Included are articles about consumer motivation, excerpts from market surveys,
				currentl client lists, and occasional JWT staff news. Originally issued
				monthly, beginning in February 1922, but publication became irregular, with no
				issue for September 1923, and varying numbers of issues for subsequent years.
				Issues are numbered sequentially (numbers 83-141) up to December 1929. In 1930,
				the publications's name changed to
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">J. Walter Thompson Bulletin</title>, with
				new numbering. </p>

               <p>Includes newsletters published by JWT's international offices.
				Whether or not JWT maintained more than one office in a particular country,
				usually one newsletter covered the market news of the whole country or major
				regions as well as the specific news of the offices (for example,
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Commodore's Log</title> of Canada,
			 reporting from the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver offices, and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Boletim JWT</title> of Brazil covering the São
			 Paulo and Rio de Janeiro offices). The newsletters are usually in the dominant
			 language used by the local office, although some are in English.</p>
               <p>In general, holdings are uneven. The two main periods where the
				holdings are deepest are the late 1950s to the middle of the 1960s and the
				first half of the 1980s, perhaps due to JWT events at the 1964-1965 New York
				World's Fair and the 1984 Epcot Swap Shop. The one nearly complete collection
				of international newsletters is the run of
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Round the Square,</title> published by
			 the London office from 1951 to 1986. </p>
               <p>Organized by geographical area in the following order: Canada;
