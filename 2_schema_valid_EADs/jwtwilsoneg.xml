         <abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">The J. Walter Thompson
		  Company (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the oldest and largest enduring
		  advertising agencies in the United States. Edward G. Wilson was an executive
		  with JWT from 1930 until his retirement in 1971, and held the positions of
		  General Counsel, Executive Vice-President and Secretary of the
		  Company.</abstract>
         <abstract encodinganalog="520">The Edward G. Wilson Papers span the
		  period 1906-1991 and includes clippings, correspondence, inter-office
		  memoranda, reports, writings, speeches and personal diaries that highlight
		  Wilson's 40 year career (1930-1971) as an executive with the J. Walter Thompson
		  Company (JWT). The bulk of materials fall between 1946 and 1971, and covers the
		  period from Wilson's return to JWT following military service in World War II
		  until his retirement. As General Counsel and head of JWT's Legal Department,
		  Wilson oversaw contractual relations pertaining primarily to the sponsorship of
		  radio and television programs for a number of clients--including DeBeers
		  Consolidated Mines, Ltd., the Eastman Kodak Company, the Ford Motor Company,
		  the Scott Paper Company and Unilever. The collection reveals JWT's
		  relationships with radio and television personalities--such as Fred Allen and
		  Edgar Bergen--and professional organizations including the Radio Writers Guild
		  and the Television Writers of America. In addition, materials in the collection
		  touch on the anti-communist movement and blacklisting within the U.S.
		  entertainment industry of the 1950s--involving personalities such as Jean Muir
		  and John Henry Faulk, among others. The collection also includes records from a
		  number of JWT international offices, with heavier representation from offices
		  in London; Bombay (Mumbai), India; and Johannesburg, South Africa, along with
		  records kept by some of Wilson's predecessors, such as Donald Foote and Sam
		  Meek, and the South African advertising executive and politician James Hamilton
		  Russell.</abstract>

               <p>Correspondence, reports, and news clippings documenting JWT's
				legal activities, primarily from the New York office, but other offices are
				also mentioned. Topics include the stockholder rights, the Profit-Sharing
				Trust, the transfer of
				<persname>Stanley and Helen Resor's</persname> controlling interest
				in the company, lawsuits that involved JWT, letters of terms for individual
				clients, compensation and contract disputes with radio and television
				personalities and their programs, contract negotiations with the
				<corpname>Radio Writers Guild</corpname> and the
				<corpname>Television Writers of America</corpname>, and lists of
				actors and actresses approved to work during the period of Hollywood
				blacklisting. Lawsuits represented in the series include <emph render="italic">Sartoris and Laemmar vs. JWT</emph>, in which the former
				charged the company for forcing them to sell back their stock in 1964. Another
				lawsuit related to the company's <emph render="doublequote">going public</emph>
				is that of <emph render="italic">Jardine vs. JWT</emph>. Both suits provide
				information about Thompson's efforts to provide incentives to senior management
				and to finance operations.</p>
               <p>The letters of terms for individual clients contain copies of
				client agreements and often include internal memoranda, correspondence with the
				client, Dun &amp; Bradstreet reports, financial statements, and press clippings
				announcing the acquisition or loss of the account. Major clients represented in
				the series include the Eisenhower-Nixon presidential campaign of 1952, Ford,
				the
				<corpname>Johns-Manville Corporation, Kellogg, Lever Brothers and
				  Sylvania.</corpname> Radio and television personalities and programs
				represented in the series include
				<persname>Fred Allen</persname> (1947-1948 only),
				<persname>Edgar Bergen (Charlie McCarthy)</persname>, the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Fred Allen Ford Dealers show</title>, Eastman
			 Kodak and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Kodak Family Adventure</title>,
			 Oriental-International Films, James Melton and Ford Motor Company TV
			 advertisements. The Fred Allen materials include clippings that describe the
			 switch of sponsors from
			 <corpname>Standard Brands</corpname> to the
			 <corpname>Ford Dealers Association</corpname>, as well as Allen's
			 reaction to the popularity of the <emph render="doublequote">giveaway</emph>
			 beginning in 1947. The name-check lists of Hollywood actors and actresses
			 include clippings and subject files documenting notable cases of blacklisting
			 and libel actions that challenged accusations of communist affiliation,
			 including those of actress Jean Muir and broadcasting personality John Henry
			 Faulk. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Reports, correspondence, articles, speeches, company statements
				and printed materials comprising Wilson's office files. Topics include
				agent-client relationships, employee evaluation and recruitment, regional
				managers' meetings, and client records, especially for the
				<corpname>Eastman Kodak Company</corpname>, the
				<corpname>Ford Motor Company</corpname> and the
				<corpname>Scott Paper Company</corpname>. Wilson solicited
				descriptions of a typical day in an international office, which are included in
				this series. The run of files for the Managers' Meetings (1959-1970) does not
				include the 1965 European manager's meeting in Milan, Italy, during which Tom
				Sutton was named as Wilson's successor as head of international operations.
				Arranged alphabetically.</p>
