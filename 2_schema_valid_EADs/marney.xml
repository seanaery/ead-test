         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of Carlyle Marney span the years 1899-1979, although the bulk of the
				collection begins in the late 1950s. Included are correspondence, writings, press
				releases, leaflets, pamphlets, bulletins, financial records, clippings, newsletters,
				calendars, reports, course materials, minutes, printed material, notes, pictures,
				tapes, and films. Reflected in the papers is information on rural poverty, the
				American Baptist Convention, the Baptist Church, especially in Texas and North
				Carolina, Christian writings, Abingdon Press, which published many of Marney's
				books, and racial prejudice. Concerning prejudice see in particular the Writings and
				Speeches Series: Marney <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">(Structures of
					Prejudice)</title> and the Correspondence Series (Church and Race
				Conference).</p>
         <p>The principal focus of the collection is Marney's professional career as a Baptist
				clergyman, serving two lengthy pastorates at First Baptist Church in Austin, Texas
				(1948-1958), and at Myers Park Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina
				(1958-1967), and as Founder-Director of Interpreters' House, an ecumenical center of
				study and work at Lake Junaluska, N. C. (1967-1978). He divided his duties to
				eventually develop a tripartite profession as a pastor, author, and speaker. He
				transcended his Southern roots to attain a national reputation as a speaker and
				theologian. The collection illuminates Marney as an independent and controversial
				figure within the Southern Baptist Church. One of the hallmarks of his ministry,
				which separated him from most Southern Baptists, was his ecumenical focus. According
				to his biographer, John J. Carey, <emph render="doublequote">Marney sought to be a
					force for Baptist renewal and to broaden the ecclesiastical and theological
					bases of the Southern Baptists.</emph>¹</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series, Writings and Speeches Series, and Engagements Series form
				the major groups in the collection. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
					Series</emph>, which comprises almost one-third of the bulk of the collection,
				consists chiefly of professional correspondence, but there is also a group of
				folders for Marney family members. Prominent correspondents include James T.
				Cleland, William Sloan Coffin, Pope A. Duncan, Findley Edge, Harry Golden, William
				J. Kilgore, Martin Luther King, Jr., Karl Menninger, Bill Moyers, Guy Ranson, and
				Elton Trueblood. Abingdon Press and the American Baptist Convention also have major
				files in this series. The Association of Southern Baptists for Scouting, Christian
				Century Foundation, and the Myers Park Baptist Church are other organizations
				represented in this series. The above-named topics also appear under appropriate
				topical headings in the Subject Files Series. There are also files in the
				Correspondence Series for the Church and Race Conference (Charlotte, N. C., 1965)
				and the God is Dead movement.</p>
         <p>Both published and unpublished works appear in the <emph render="bold">Writings and
					Speeches Series</emph>. Marney was the author of twelve books and contributed
				articles to various theological journals; other single sermons appear in various
				anthologies. Most of his books were published by Abingdon Press, a Methodist
				publisher. There is also a copy of the book published in 1953, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">These Things Remain,</title> as well as
				television programs, 1954, under the same title. Included in this series are the
				texts of unpublished books, such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">City of
					Light/City of Wilderness,</title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Great Encounter,</title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Recovery of the Church,</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tragic Man/Tragic House.</title>
         </p>
         <p>In the files of writings of other persons are works of Karl Menninger and Guy Ranson,
				who also appear in Marney's correspondence. Other writers appearing in this section
				are Rufus Carrollton Harris, William Jackson Kilgore, Franklin Hamlin Littell, John
				David Maguire, Orval Hobart Mowrer, H. Richard Niebuhr, Schubert Miles Ogden, Clyde
				Penrose St. Amant, and John Egnar Skoglund.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Engagements Series</emph>, 1958-1978, primarily reflects the
				latter portion of Marney's career, during his tenure at Myers Park Baptist Church
				and at Interpreters' House. Both this series and the Calendars Series testify to
				Marney's busy schedule of speaking appointments, especially during the Myers Park
				pastorate. In fact, the church hired a full-time administrator to aid in managing
				the daily activities of the church. Marney preached at major colleges, universities,
				and seminaries across the United States, including Harvard University, Yale
				University, and Duke University. He accepted a variety of speaking engagements
				including the Chautauqua Institute in New York; the Massanetta Center in Virginia;
				worship services; conferences and symposia; religious organizations, such as Temple
				Beth El Sisterhood; retreats; and the North Carolina Council of Churches. In
				addition, Marney spoke at military installations, the Southern Textile Association,
				and various secular organizations and clubs, such as the Chamber of Commerce,
				Sertoma Club, and YMCA.</p>
         <p>Two major topics in the <emph render="bold">Subject Series</emph> are the Christian
				Century Foundation, of which Marney was a trustee, and the Ministers and
				Missionaries Benefit Board of the American Baptist Convention. These two topics
				overlap with files in the Correspondence Series. Other files of interest include
				Abingdon Press, the Boy Scouts of America, the Committee on Religion in Appalachia,
				First Baptist Church (Austin), Myers Park Baptist Church, and the Southern Baptist
				Theological Seminary. There is also a mimeographed copy of a diary (prepared from
				tapes), 1954, Sept.-Nov., that Marney wrote on a trip to Korea and Japan, as part of
				a preaching mission for the Army and Air Force in the Far East.</p>
         <p>The President's National Advisory Commission on Rural Poverty Series contains reports
				on aspects of rural poverty, such as economics, education, conservation and
				development of natural resources, health and medical care, government, housing, and
				farming.</p>
         <p>The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Series includes notes on such topics as
				Christian missions, church history, theology, and Old and New Testament studies. An
				early volume, 1899-1902, contains notes for a class by W. O. Carver on Christian
				missions.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Notes Series</emph> contains notes Marney made from the works
				of various theologians and other authors, such as F.S.C. Northrop, Hans Reichenbach,
				A. C. Reid, Paul Tillich, Harold H. Titus, Arnold J. Toynbee, and Alfred North
				Whitehead.</p>
         <p>In the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Series</emph> features sermons, lectures, and
				books in the following formats: cassette tapes, reel-to-reel tapes, and motion
				picture films. Of particular interest are the series of reel-to-reel tapes of
				Laymen's Hour recordings and the Massanetta Springs Recordings made by Marney. The
				Laymen's Hour was a radio broadcast; most of the recordings in this series are in
				1965, with one in 1962. Massanetta Springs, Inc. is the Conference Center of the
				Synod of Virginia, Presbyterian Church, U. S., located near Harrisonburg, Va. These
				recordings, 1957-1974, were a series of annual lectures at Bible conferences at the
				center. Originals are closed to use, but listening copies are available for many of
				the recordings; otherwise staff need to arrange to have use copies made. Please
				consult with Research Services staff before coming to use this collection.</p>
