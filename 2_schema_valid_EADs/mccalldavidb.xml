		  the children's educational television series
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Schoolhouse Rock</title>. </abstract>
         <abstract encodinganalog="520">The David B. McCall Papers span the years
		  1939-1999, with the bulk documenting the years 1980-1994, and are comprised of
		  clippings, correspondence, business reports, photographs, scrapbooks, speeches
		  and writings, videocassettes, audio tapes and phonograph records. In
		  particular, three main areas of McCall's career are represented: as an
		  advertising executive and partner in agencies such as Young &amp; Rubicam,
		  Ogilvy Benson &amp; Mather, McCaffrey &amp; McCall, David J. Mahoney, Inc., the
		  Sawyer Miller Group, and Shepardson Stern and Kaminsky; as a corporate director
		  for the Hunter Fan Company, Save the Children, and two local radio broadcasting
		  corporations, among others; and as a humanitarian involved with organizations
		  such as the Committee for the Support of Roe v. Wade, CARE, and Refugees
		  International. In addition, there is a substantial body of McCall's speeches
		  and writings that reflect both the wide range of his professional and personal
		  interests and commitments as well as his status as a public intellectual in
		  high demand, as well as a number of files containing correspondence, clippings
		  and articles concerning David Ogilvy, McCall's mentor in advertising. Major
		  advertising campaigns represented in this collection include Mercedes Benz of
		  North America, North American Philips,
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Life</title> magazine, the American Can Company,
		  Lever Brothers Company, and the Zippo Manufacturing Company, along with public
		  relations work for such clients as the National Football League, Puerto Rico
		  Telephone Company (PRTC), and the Regional Bell Operating Companies. Major
		  humanitarian issues documented in the collection include the
		  <emph render="doublequote">Unsell</emph> protest movement against the war in
		  Vietnam, tobacco advertising aimed at children, land mine removal, refugee
		  welfare, and support of abortion rights. McCall was also involved in political
		  campaigns for a number of notable candidates, such as John Lindsay (New York),
		  Harvey Gannt (North Carolina), George Kevarian (Massachusetts), Ramón Mitra
		  (Philippines) and Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru). While McCall is recognized as the
		  originator of the idea behind the popular children's educational television
		  series
		  <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Schoolhouse Rock!</title>, the collection
		  contains very little documentation concerning that project apart from a copy of
		  the original soundtrack. </abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The David B. McCall Papers span the years 1939-1999, with the bulk
		  documenting the years 1980-1994, and are comprised of clippings,
		  correspondence, business reports, photographs, scrapbooks, speeches and
		  writings, videocassettes, audio tapes and phonograph records. In particular,
		  three main areas of McCall's career are represented: as an advertising
		  executive and partner in agencies such as
		  <corpname>Young &amp; Rubicam</corpname>,
		  <corpname>Ogilvy Benson &amp; Mather</corpname>,
		  <corpname>McCaffrey &amp; McCall</corpname>,
		  <corpname>David J. Mahoney, Inc.</corpname>, the
		  <corpname>Sawyer Miller Group</corpname>, and
		  <corpname>Shepardson Stern and Kaminsky</corpname>; as a corporate
		  director for the
		  <corpname>Hunter Fan Company</corpname>,
		  <corpname>Save the Children</corpname>, and two local radio
		  broadcasting corporations, among others; and as a humanitarian involved with
		  organizations such as the
		  <corpname>Committee for the Support of Roe v. Wade</corpname>,
		  <corpname>CARE</corpname>, and
		  <corpname>Refugees International</corpname>. In addition, there is a
		  substantial body of McCall's speeches and writings that reflect both the wide
		  range of his professional and personal interests and commitments as well as his
		  status as a public intellectual in high demand, as well as a number of files
		  containing correspondence, clippings and articles concerning David Ogilvy,
		  McCall's mentor in advertising. Major advertising campaigns represented in this
		  collection include
		  <corpname>Mercedes Benz of North America</corpname>,
		  <corpname>North American Philips</corpname>,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Life</title> magazine, the
		<corpname>American Can Company</corpname>,
		<corpname>Lever Brothers Company</corpname>, and the
		<corpname>Zippo Manufacturing Company</corpname>, along with public
		relations work for such clients as the
		<corpname>National Football League</corpname>,
		<corpname>Puerto Rico Telephone Company (PRTC)</corpname>, and the
		<corpname>Regional Bell Operating Companies</corpname>. Major
		humanitarian issues documented in the collection include the
		<emph render="doublequote">Unsell</emph> protest movement against the war in
		Vietnam, tobacco advertising aimed at children, land mine removal, refugee
		welfare, and support of abortion rights. McCall was also involved in political
		campaigns for a number of notable candidates, such as John Lindsay (New York),
		Harvey Gannt (North Carolina), George Kevarian (Massachusetts), Ramón Mitra
		(Philippines) and Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru). While McCall is recognized as the
		originator of the idea behind the popular children's educational television
		series
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Schoolhouse Rock!</title>, the collection contains
		very little documentation concerning that project apart from a copy of the
		original soundtrack.</p>
         <p>The collection is organized into 12 series that broadly outline the
		  sequence of McCall's business and humanitarian activities: the
		  <emph render="bold">Biographical and Personal Materials Series,</emph> the
		  <emph render="bold">Ogilvy &amp; Mather Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">McCaffrey &amp; McCall Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Radio Stations Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Sawyer
		  Miller Group Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Hunter Fan Company
		  Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Shepardson, Stern &amp; Kaminsky
		  Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Refugees International Series</emph>,
		  the <emph render="bold">Speeches Series</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Portfolio
		  Series</emph>. In addition, non-print materials have been removed to the
		  <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph>. Large-format print
		  materials have been removed from their original series locations and relocated
		  to <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> locations; these items have
		  been cross-referenced to the points in the body of the collection from which
		  they were removed. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Biographical and Personal Materials
		  Series</emph> contains materials relating to McCall's childhood and family
		  life, and includes correspondence, photographs, biographical sketches, resumes
		  and obituary notices. The <emph render="bold">Ogilvy &amp; Mather Series</emph>
		  includes correspondence and articles pertaining to the agency, along with
		  profiles and tributes to agency founder
		  <persname>David Ogilvy</persname> and correspondence between Ogilvy and
		  McCall. The <emph render="bold">McCaffrey &amp; McCall Series</emph> includes
		  correspondence, corporate publications and client files. Legal documents that
		  detail McCall's initial investment and employment in the C.J. Laroche &amp; Co.
		  agency, which was eventually renamed McCaffrey &amp; McCall, are included.
		  Major clients include
		  <corpname>Mercedes-Benz of North America</corpname>, the
		  <corpname>New York Zoological Society</corpname>, and
		  <corpname>Save the Children</corpname>. The agency was also involved in
		  the political campaign of New York Mayor
		  <persname>John Lindsay</persname>. The <emph render="bold">Radio
		  Stations Series</emph> includes correspondence, periodic reports and
		  profit-and-loss statements for the 790 Communications Corporation and the 1340
		  Broadcasting Corporation, radio broadcasting corporations in which McCaffrey
		  &amp; McCall had invested, and in which McCall remained involved after retiring
		  from the agency. The <emph render="bold">Sawyer Miller Group Series</emph>
		  contains administrative records, correspondence and client files. Sawyer Miller
		  was instrumental in helping the telecommunications industry after the breakup
		  of the Bell system into regional operating companies. Other clients included
		  the
		  <corpname>National Football League</corpname> and the
		  <corpname>Puerto Rico Telephone Company</corpname>, along with a number
		  of political candidates. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Hunter Fan Company Series</emph> consists
