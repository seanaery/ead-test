         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of
		  <persname>Robin Morgan</persname> date from the 1940s to 2010, with the
		  bulk of the material dating between 1970 and 2000. The collection documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of the life of an important
		  feminist writer of the twentieth century. It is organized into the following series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Writings, Speeches and Interviews,
		  Subject Files, Personal Files, Teaching Materials, Audio-Visual Materials, Photographic and Visual Materials, and Oversize Material. </emph>The largest group of
		  materials consists of documentation on all of Morgan's significant written works:
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Demon Lover; </title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Depth Perception; </title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Dry Your Smile; </title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Going Too Far; </title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Hot January; </title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lady of the Beasts; </title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Saturday's Child; </title>her
		well-known feminist anthologies,
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sisterhood is Powerful
		  </title>and
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href=""> Sisterhood is Global</title>;
		and other materials on her poems, articles, and other writings. In addition,
		Morgan's papers hold many items of
		<genreform>correspondence </genreform>with a wide range of individuals,
		including prominent activists and feminists as well as family members and close
		friends. There is also a significant amount of correspondence and other
		material that documents Morgan's role as founder of the Sisterhood is Global
		Institute, and records related to her role as editor and writer for
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> magazine.</p>
         <p>Seen in a broader context, the collection provides ample documentation
		  for the study of modern feminism. Morgan's subject files (the second largest in
		  the series) are rich in materials related to the feminist movement in the
		  United States and around the world; and materials concerning
		  <subject>sexual health, </subject>
            <subject>witchcraft, </subject>
            <subject>lesbian feminism, </subject>and the social, economic, and
		  political position of women in the world (especially in the
		  <geogname>Middle East, </geogname>
            <geogname>Russia, </geogname>and
		  <geogname>South Africa). </geogname> There are materials on individual
		  figures such as

         </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> spans much of
		  Morgan's adult life. It is divided into two subseries: <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Name</emph> and <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Name Subseries</emph> chiefly consists of
		  Morgan's correspondence with family members, friends, fellow feminist activists
		  and contemporary authors and critics. The bulk of the items in the
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade Subseries</emph> dates from the
		  1990s and relates to the production of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> magazine. <emph render="bold">The
		Correspondence Series is restricted</emph>: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of
		Legal Rights and Responsibilities form before using the materials.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> documents Morgan's
		  career as a poet, novelist, essayist and journalist. Of Morgan's eighteen
		  books, ten are represented in individual subseries. Particularly noteworthy is
		  the material related to
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sisterhood is Global,</title>
		which provides an inside view into the production of the anthology. The series
		also contains some of Morgan's earliest unpublished writings as well as files
		containing her comments on other writers' work, and single issues of
		<genreform>periodicals in which </genreform>she published her poetry. <emph render="bold">The
		Writings Series is also restricted</emph>: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of
		Legal Responsibilities and Privacy Rights form before using the materials.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Speeches and Interviews Series</emph>
		  primarily contains peripheral documentation such as contracts, correspondence,
		  and schedules. However, there are drafts of a number of her speeches and
		  interviews.</p>
         <p>Materials which Morgan collected over the years concerning American
		  and international feminism are located in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files
		  Series</emph>. The materials cover a number of topics, including women's
		  economic, political, and social status, and feminist action - especially in
		  South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East;
		  <subject>rape, </subject>
            <subject>abortion, </subject>
            <subject>terrorism, </subject>
            <subject>female genital mutilation,</subject> and
		  <subject>pornography</subject>; and the first feminist demonstration
		  against the
		  <subject>Miss America Pageant</subject>. Significant figures
		  represented in the subject files include
		  <persname>Marilyn Waring, </persname>
            <persname>Patricia Hearst, </persname> and Gloria Steinem. Two
		  subseries contain administrative information about
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> magazine and the
		<corpname>Sisterhood is Global Institute. <emph render="bold">The Subjects Series is
		  restricted</emph>: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Rights and
		  Responsibilities form before using the materials.</corpname>
         </p>
         <p>The smaller <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series</emph> offers
		  materials related to Robin Morgan's education, early critical writing, and her
		  many trips overseas. The series also includes material that Morgan requested
		  under the Freedom of Information Act from the
		  <corpname>FBI</corpname> and
		  <corpname>CIA</corpname> about her own activities. </p>
         <p>The documents in the <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials
		  Series</emph> are primarily related to Morgan's academic positions at
		  <corpname>New College </corpname>
            <geogname>(Sarasota, Fla.)</geogname> and the
		  <corpname>University of Denver, </corpname>and the courses she taught
		  on feminism and writing. The files include both administrative documentation as
		  well as actual course material, but there are also clippings related to
		  feminist protests on campus.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">The Audio-Visual Materials Series</emph> contains
		  numerous
		  <genreform>interviews on cassette tapes</genreform> that Morgan
		  conducted in the Middle East, a recording of her reading of selected poems from

		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Hot January</title>, and a
		<genreform>videotape</genreform> about the production of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Saturday's Child.</title>
		Permission is not granted to publish interviews conducted in the Middle East;
		the researcher is responsible for obtaining permission to publish. Original
		copies of audiovisual materials are not open to use; however, use copies are
		available to researchers.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographic and Visual Materials Series</emph> provides
		  a small visual supplement to the other documents in the collection and includes
		  portrait photographs of Morgan taken by the press and by her close friends, as well as
		  snapshots of social gatherings. This series also includes two painted <genreform>portraits </genreform> of Morgan. <emph render="bold">The series is restricted</emph>: patrons
		  must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Rights and Responsibilities form before using the materials.</p>

               <p>The series is divided into two subseries: <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Name</emph> and <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade</emph>, both of which contain letters to
				and from Robin Morgan. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Name
				Subseries</emph> is organized alphabetically by last name or place. Prominent
				correspondents include feminists such as
				<persname>Simone de Beauvoir, </persname>
                  <persname>Sallie Bingham, </persname>
                  <persname>Kate Millett, </persname>
                  <persname>Adrienne Rich,</persname> and
				<persname>Gloria Steinem.</persname> There are also letters of a
				personal nature with Morgan's mother, aunts, and close friends, such as
				<persname>Vladimir Urban.</persname> Particularly voluminous is the
				correspondence from
				<persname>Isel Rivero </persname>(further documented in the
				<emph render="bold">Photographic and Visual Materials Series</emph>), with whom Robin
				Morgan maintained a close relationship during the 1980s, and from
				<persname>Jane Alpert.</persname> The latter provides interesting
				insights into a woman's life in the underground and in
				<subject>prison</subject> during the mid-1970s. </p>
               <p>While there are several letters in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Decade Subseries</emph> that date from the
				1950s and 1960s (including a letter from
				<persname>Nehru</persname>), the bulk of the correspondence comes
				from the 1990s. Material from this decade includes letters of both a personal
				and professional nature; one group of folders contains correspondence
				pertaining solely to the period during which Morgan was
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> magazine's
			 editor in chief. In this subseries, the correspondence is arranged in original
			 order, by decade only.</p>

                  <genreform>anthologies,</genreform> and

				published works. Within each subseries, documents are in the original order to
				reflect the publishing process. Materials in the <emph render="bold">Poems</emph>, <emph render="bold">Other Writings by
				Morgan</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings by Others,</emph> and
				<emph render="bold">Grants</emph> subseries are all in chronological order.

               <p>The material related to the production of the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sisterhood is Global
				</title>anthology is particularly extensive. It includes files on individual
			 contributors, which contain ephemeral publications and correspondence providing
			 insights into the lives of women in different parts of the world. Less
			 extensive material on shorter published and unpublished works can be found in
			 the <emph render="bold">Poems Subseries </emph>and <emph render="bold">Other
			 Writings by Morgan Subseries</emph>. Particularly noteworthy in the latter are
			 samples of Morgan's earliest writings, which reveal an acute sense of humour
			 and sensitivity at an early age, and the many folders of Morgan's comments on
			 other women's works. Finally, at the end of the <emph render="bold">Writings
			 Series</emph>, there are a few manuscripts by other authors, including poetry
			 and a
			 <genreform>dissertation</genreform> about Morgan's work. </p>

				portion of the subseries comes from the years when Morgan acted as editor-in
				chief (1989-1993) and re-launched the
				<genreform>magazine</genreform> as an international bimonthly free
				of advertising. There is also material concerning the 1980 issue of

               <p>Accession (2010-0176) (18,450 items; 24.6 lin. ft.; dated 1947-2010) includes Morgan's travel files, correspondence, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> editorial files, and materials from her research and publications. General correspondence (dating 1996-2009) consists of email printouts and letters detailing Morgan's activities with various projects, conferences, and boards, including Equality Now and the February Sisters. It also includes her thoughts on the 2008 presidential election, including a re-written version of <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Goodbye to All That</title> discussing the Hillary Clinton campaign.</p>
               <p>The <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> files (dating 2002-2010) include global dispatches, correspondence, and cover story interviews by Morgan of Madeleine Albright and Jane Fonda. This section also contains files from the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Ms.</title> search for editor-in-chief.</p>
               <p>A large portion of the accession relates to Morgan's writings, poetry, and published books. These materials consist of drafts, correspondence with publishers, publicity and press, reader reactions, reviews of her work, and rights permissions. Works represented include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Monster</title>, which included the poem <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Arraignment;</title>
                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">The Mysteries,</title> a play; <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Upstairs in the Garden</title>; <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Going Too Far</title>; <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Anatomy of Freedom</title>; <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Witch Tales</title>; <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sisterhood is Forever</title>; and other poems and articles. The majority of the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sisterhood is Forever</title> materials are contributor files, including women like Gloria Steinem, Eleanor Smeal, Eve Ensler, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, and many others.</p>
               <p>Also represented are supporting materials, mainly clippings and other miscellaneous items, from Morgan's childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood that she used for writing her <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Memoirs</title>. These clippings include coverage of her activities as a child star on the television show <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Mama</title>, as well as her other performances, radio and television shows, and modelling engagements. Morgan's early activities in the women's liberation movement are also represented in these clippings, such as her protesting the Miss America competition in 1969 and coverage of her book, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sisterhood Is Powerful</title>. The original clippings are extremely fragile and may require Technical Services intervention.</p>
               <p>Other materials in the accession include various research and project files, many supporting Morgan's activities or writings. For example, there is a series of folders on clitoredectomy and female genital mutilation, culminating in a draft prepared by Morgan and Gloria Steinem of an article published in the 1970s. Materials from the Women's Media Center are closed due to restrictions. There is also a significant amount of audiovisual material, including film, VHS, reel-to-reel audio, and DVDs. These will require reformatting prior to use by researchers.</p>
