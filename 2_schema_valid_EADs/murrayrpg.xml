         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Table-top role-playing games (RPGs) are a type of game where players create or assume the role of various characters and collaborate to imagine and build a story or quest. Each players' characterization offers guidelines and expectations for the abilities and tendencies of their character, and their proposed actions succeed or fail based on the game's established rules and statistics. One player may serve as a gamemaster to guide fellow players through the game and introduce new challenges or twists to the story.</p>
         <p>Modern role-playing games emerged in the 1970s, with the first commercially available game, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, published in 1974. It quickly became very popular, leading to copycats and competitors as well as enabling the development of RPG supporting material, such as campaign sets, miniatures and playing pieces, new literature, and fan magazines. Other popular games quickly followed, such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</title> in 1977, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Traveller </title>in 1977, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">RuneQuest</title> in 1978, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Call of Cthulhu</title> in 1981, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">James Bond</title> in 1983. </p>
         <p>RPGs continued to grow and evolved through the late 1980s and 1990s. General game systems emerged, allowing for a single set of rules that worked with any setting. Another notable milestone was the release of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Magic: The Gathering</title> in 1993, which proved very popular and resulted in more spin-offs and competition in the field of collectible card games. Early computer games frequently adopted or mimicked RPG rules, eliminating the need for a gamemaster and increasing the game's speed. Many contemporary video games share their terminology, settings, and game mechanics with pen-and-paper RPGs.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection includes thousands of game books, boxed sets, figurines, cards, magazines and serials. It also includes a small amount of manuscript material from the Murrays' own campaign notes and records. The materials have been divided into series based on format: Boxed Games (BG); Modules, Manuals, and Campaign Volumes (M); Miniatures and Pieces (P); Cards (C); Serials (S); and Manuscripts (MS). Within each series, materials have been sorted into their various game worlds and settings as best as possible. Along with Box and Volume numbers, barcodes for each item are included to ease research requests from Duke's offsite storage facility. Due to the vast number of games and the wide variety of research interests for this collection, a downloadable spreadsheet is available for researchers interested in browsing and sorting the games in different ways, such as by year or by box.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Please note:</emph> The collection contains loose parts such as dice, tokens, figurines, cards, etc. Some materials may be sealed in original packaging. Packaged materials in Miniatures series are intended to remain in sealed packaging. Please consult Research Services staff for assistance with removal of other materials from sealed packaging. Please return materials to original packaging whenever possible. Consult Research Services staff for assistance if materials cannot be returned to original packaging.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Boxed Games (BG) series</emph> includes games from a range of worlds, as well as a large number of general games that date from the early 1970s to the mid-2000s. Large sub-series within the Boxed Games series include game settings and worlds like <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Forgotten Realms</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">James Bond</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">DragonLance</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">RuneQuest</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Star Trek</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Supremacy</title>; but, there are many more from a large number of different systems. Boxed Games typically include campaign books and characterization sheets, grids or maps for game play, die, and rule books. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Modules, Manuals, and Campaign Volumes (M) series</emph> is the largest series in the collection, with over 2300 distinct volumes from numerous game worlds and settings. The series includes a variety of publications, ranging from traditional modules with a plot and characters included, to manuals with lists of creatures or characters, to reference guides for various game worlds. Many companies published only volumes, with no accompanying boxed game, and so there are a large number of titles that have no correlation to the Boxed Games series. The largest game worlds or settings represented in this series are <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Call of Cthulhu</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Cyberpunk</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Forgotten Realms</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Middle-Earth</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Traveller</title>; but, there are many, many more from different game worlds as well as independent, one-time games. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Miniatures and Pieces (P) series</emph> includes packaged and loose miniatures collected by the Murrays from a number of different companies. Most are generic and not attached to a particular game or game brand, although there are hundreds that were intended for playing with games like <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Call of Cthulhu</title>, DC or Marvel Superheroes, or <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Lord of the Rings</title>. Along with metal miniatures, the series also includes other various types of gameplay aids, including settings guides, grids, and miscellany. A portion of this series consists of unpackaged, handpainted miniatures that have been specially housed for preservation.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Serials (S) series</emph> contains fanzines and magazines collected by the Murrays relating to RPGs and RPG culture. Most magazine runs are incomplete and date from the late 1970s to the mid-2000s; the boxlist includes details about which issues are present in the collection. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Cards (C) series</emph> includes cards from several years of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Magic: The Gathering</title>, as well as smaller amounts of cards of other games such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Legend of the Five Rings</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New Aeon</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Sim City</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Spellfire</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">On the Edge</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Jyhad</title>. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Manuscripts (MS) series</emph> is the smallest series in the collection, containing campaign and collecting notes from the Murrays.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

               <p>The Modules, Manuals, and Campaign Volumes series includes books designed to accompany or enable role-playing in a variety of worlds. A volume typically includes campaign settings, character guides, game system rules, or reference tools for players. Worlds represented in this series include Dungeons and Dragons, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Birthright, Cyberpunk, Call of Cthulhu, Dragon Lance, Earthdawn, Forgotten Realms, Middle Earth, Ravenloft, Spell Jammer, and many more.</p>

            <arrangement>
               <p>Most volumes are individually numbered and barcoded, unless they included extra components that required them to be housed in a box. There are 6 boxes of volumes (M1-M6) included in this series. All volumes (regardless of volume or box number) have been arranged by alphabetically by game world, then chronologically by date. General volumes that have no identifiable "world" are listed at the end in alphabetical order. A spreadsheet is available for researchers who are interested in sorting the games in a different way.</p>

               <p>The Miniatures series consists of small playing pieces created by several companies, which were designed to be used as part of table top role-playing games. Many miniatures were deliberately generic, and were not designated for any particular brand of game. Most miniatures dating from the 1980s were very small, on a 15mm or 25mm scale, and were made with lead-based metals. Later miniatures (dating from the 1990s) were made with lead-free pewter or plastic. Players could purchase the packs of miniatures and then paint them, which along with adding color served to make the pieces more durable for long-term use. </p>
               <p>The miniatures in this collection represent a wide range of themes and companies. The majority of the miniatures are intended for play with dungeon-themed role-playing games. Many miniatures represent magical characters such as dragons, monsters, warriors, elves, knights, gods, or princesses. Other games represented include <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Traveller</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Call of Cthulhu</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Indiana Jones</title>, comic superheroes from both DC Comics and Marvel Comics, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Lord of the Rings</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">RuneQuest</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">BattleTech</title>. The majority of the miniatures in this collection are from the Ral Partha, Grenadier Models, and Citadel Miniatures companies.</p>
               <p>The series consists of approximately 660 unopened packs of miniatures. Miscellaneous supplementary materials are also included in this series, such as maps, exansion sets, and blank character cards. Items have been arranged alphabetically by company, and by series within those companies.</p>
               <p>The series also contains hundreds of hand-painted loose miniatures, some of which were handpainted by the Murrays.</p>
