         <abstract label="Abstract">Bobbye Ortiz was a social activist and Marxist feminist.  The collection consists chiefly of
        personal correspondence; extensive subject files on international political and cultural
        movements; photographs and slides; ephemeral publication material such as grassroots
        newsletters, pamphlets, broadsides, and clippings; cultural artifacts, including buttons and
        T-shirts; and over 300 sound recordings of spoken voice and music (see separate catalog
        record for sound recordings). The collection documents the personal life and career of an
        international feminist, Marxist activist, and mother, who also served as editor of the
        magazine Monthly Review and was the founder of the organization WIRE (Women's International
        Resource Exchange).</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of feminist and social activist <persname>Bobbye Ortiz </persname>span from the
        years 1919 to 1993, with most of the papers being dated between 1950 and 1990. The papers
        consist chiefly of personal correspondence; extensive subject files on international
        political and cultural movements; <genreform>photographs </genreform>and <genreform>slides;
        </genreform> ephemeral publication material such as grassroots <genreform>newsletters, </genreform>
            <genreform>pamphlets, </genreform>
            <genreform>broadsides, </genreform>and <genreform>clippings; </genreform>cultural artifacts,
        including buttons and T-shirts; and over 300 <genreform>sound recordings </genreform>of
        spoken voice and music. The collection documents the personal life and career of an
        international feminist, Marxist activist, and mother, who also served as editor of the
        magazine <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Monthly Review </title> and was the
        founder of the organization WIRE (Women's International Resource Exchange). Other personal
        documents and subject files concern the activities of Bobbye's daughter, Viki Ortiz, an
        activist in her own right. The materials in both women's files are especially rich in the
        history of the international <subject>women's liberation movement </subject>and other
        revolutionary movements in <geogname>Europe, </geogname>
            <geogname>Latin America, </geogname>and other countries during the sixties, seventies, and
        eighties. Many of these materials focus on politics and government in <geogname>Cuba, </geogname>
            <geogname>China, </geogname>and <geogname>France. </geogname>Other topics include
          <subject>Vietnam War </subject>protests; students' movements, particularly
          <geogname>Paris, </geogname>1968; indigenous women's movements in <geogname>Latin America;
        </geogname>AIDS activism; <subject>sexual health; </subject>
            <subject>adoption </subject> rights; <subject>gay and lesbian parenting; </subject>and
        women's issues such as <subject>reproductive rights, </subject>economic status, and
          <subject>violence against women. </subject>
         </p>
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> is almost completely CLOSED to
        research; see the inventory below for more information. Most materials in other series,
        however, are open for research.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series </emph>focuses on Ortiz's formal education,
        particularly her coursework at <corpname>New York University. </corpname>Other highlights of
        the series include Ortiz's <genreform>scrapbook </genreform>from her tour of
          <geogname>China, </geogname>which is further documented by <genreform>audio tapes
        </genreform>and <genreform>photographs </genreform>in the collection. Writings folders
        include notes, short articles, and <genreform>speeches </genreform>written by Ortiz as well
        as a collection of poetry by <persname>Grace Goldin, </persname>a friend of Ortiz. Two
        folders contain photocopies of inscriptions from many authors found inside the volumes in
        her personal library (now in the Perkins Library stacks of Duke University). This series is
        partially CLOSED.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series </emph>has been separated into two main
        subseries: one devoted to <subject>international women's liberation </subject>and one for
        general topics. In the <emph render="bold">International Women's Liberation Subseries,
        </emph>Ortiz maintained extensive files on the status of women and <subject>women's

         <p>The <emph render="bold">General Files Subseries </emph>consists mainly of
          <genreform>articles, </genreform>notes, and <genreform>periodicals </genreform>from the
        1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Especially noteworthy are notes and other papers related to Ortiz's
        work as associate editor of the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Monthly Review,
        </title>though these provide only a limited glimpse into her decades of service there. The
        subseries also contains materials related to health, <subject>cancer, </subject>and the

            <subject>feminism, </subject>
            <subject>women's liberation, </subject>and the <corpname>Women's International Resource
          Exchange </corpname> (WIRE); and the political turmoil of <subject>Paris 1968.
        </subject>Together, Ortiz's subject files reflect the directions of her activism in the

         <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs and Slides Series </emph> contains portraits of
        individuals and groups, photographs taken during tours of countries and political events,
        and miscellaneous casual snapshots. There are very fine <genreform>portraits </genreform>of
        native peoples taken by well-known activist <persname>Gertrude Duby Blom. </persname> The
        largest segment of the series documents Ortiz's trips to <geogname>China </geogname>in 1974
        and <geogname>Latin America </geogname>(ca. 1984). For related materials, see the <emph render="bold">Audio Tapes Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Personal Files
          Series</emph>. There are also <genreform>audio cassettes </genreform>recorded in
          <geogname>Latin America </geogname>and <geogname>Nicaragua, </geogname>which may
        correspond with slides in the Photographs and Slides Series. This series ends with photo
        negatives of an <subject>International Women's Day </subject>March in 1978. <emph render="bold"> Note: This series is restricted. Use copies must be made of any cassettes

            <genreform>Posters, </genreform>
            <genreform>buttons, </genreform>and T-shirts bearing slogans and vivid images were vital
        components of the many social movements in which both Bobbye and Victoria Ortiz
        participated. The <emph render="bold">Cultural Artifacts Series </emph>captures the
        political use of popular culture in the late 20th century by preserving a representative
        sample of these cultural artifacts. The selections reflect Bobbye and Viki's participation
        in social movements concerned with issues such as U.S. imperialism in <geogname>Latin
          America, </geogname>
            <subject>international women's liberation, </subject>
            <subject>AIDS, </subject> and <subject>lesbian and gay rights. </subject>The series also
        contains original artwork done for Bobbye and Viki, as well as <genreform>art posters
        </genreform>from France. Several oversize <genreform>posters </genreform>are artifacts from
        the French worker/student strikes of 1968.</p>
         <p>The majority of tapes in the <emph render="bold">Audio Tapes Series </emph>are cassette
        recordings of tours taken by Bobbye Ortiz during her travels in <geogname>China
        </geogname>and <geogname>Latin America. </geogname> Additional tapes include recordings of
        radio programs, interviews, and readings related to Bobbye's <subject>activism.
        </subject>Descriptive notes on many of the tapes listed below have been included as an
        appendix to this inventory.<emph render="bold"> Note: This series is restricted. Use copies

         <p>The complete holdings of Bobbye Ortiz's library, which were donated as part of this
        collection and reside in Perkins Library at Duke University, are represented by the
        hand-written <emph render="bold">Index Card Catalog Series. </emph>The hundreds of
          <corpname>Monthly Review Press </corpname>publications in the library are one of the few
        records in the Ortiz Collection of her work for over twenty years as associate editor of the
          <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Monthly Review.</title> The range of topics
        covered by her library -- women, <subject>Marxism </subject>and <subject>socialism, </subject>

        intellectual interests and their intimate connections to her political concerns. The catalog
        is organized by topic, alphabetically by author therein. </p>
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Phonograph Records Series </emph>features sound recordings on 33
        1/3, 45, and 78 LPs collected by Bobbye Ortiz during her travels. Hundreds of <subject>folk
          music </subject>recordings, protest and labor song collections, and miscellaneous spoken
        word recordings date from the 1960s to the 1980s. Recording artists include many well-known
        musicians as well as hundreds of other musicians interested in folk, labor, and protest
        music; major languages represented include Spanish, French, and Italian. Many of these
        recordings are now out of print and difficult to find. <emph render="bold">This series is
