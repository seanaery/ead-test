         <p>During his adolescent years, John O'Toole wrote several plays for a local radio station and over 200 poems for newspapers, magazines and anthologies. At age 18, one of his books of poetry was published; the proceeds from this publication paid for his first year of college.</p>
         <p>O'Toole worked as a waiter, radio announcer and meter reader before beginning a career in the advertising business. O'Toole's first advertising job was for Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn, where he served as copywriter on the accounts Royal Crown Cola, Ac'cent, and Amity Leather Products. In 1954, he joined the staff of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding (FCB), where he began as Copy Writer and subsequently became Copy Supervisor, Vice President, Creative Director of the Los Angeles and Chicago offices. During his career, he wrote copy and campaign themes for more than 40 television commercials. Some of his major clients included the First National Bank of Chicago, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, General Foods, Armour Soap Works and Kraft Foods.</p>
         <p>O'Toole also served prominently in the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), as Director and then President of the Association. He also served as Director of the National Advertising Review Council, and served on the Board of Directors of John Nuveen Mutual Funds. </p>
