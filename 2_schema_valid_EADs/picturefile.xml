         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Picture File is a large and diverse
		  collection of visual materials ranging from the 17th through the 20th
		  centuries. The bulk of the images in the collection date from the early 1800s
		  through the 1950s. Formats represented include black and white photographic
		  prints; cartes de visite, cabinet cards and other albumen prints; tintypes and
		  daguerreotypes; engravings and lithographs; political cartoons; watercolors; sketches; postcards;
		  stereographs; souvenir albums; leaflets; and small broadsides. Organized into
		  four main series: <emph render="bold">Subjects, Geographic, Socialist Party, and People</emph>. The images
		  offer representations of the landscape, culture, and history of most of the
		  southern United States, especially Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Many images of France, Italy,
		  Germany, Japan, China, and some African countries can also be found; a large number of other countries and geographic locations are represented by only a few images. Many political figures and notable personages are portrayed; there are especially significant numbers of images of Eugene Debs, Socialist Party leader, and members of the Duke family of Durham, N.C. The history of that same city is also well-represented, in
		  addition to other Southern cities and towns, including Raleigh N.C. Civil War images are abundant,
		  offering views of battles and scenes of devastation both rural and urban. Other
		  conflicts are also depicted, including the American Revolutionary War,
		  Spanish-American War, and there are some images from both World Wars. A significant group of
		  items in the People Series pertains to African Americans, ranging from
		  studio portraits to caricatures of individuals and groups of individuals; a
		  smaller group of images features depictions of Native Americans. Finally, the Picture File is home
		  to collections of many engravings and lithographs produced by the 19th century
		  American companies Currier and Ives, L. Prang and Co., and Kurz and Allison;
		  many of them commemorate military leaders or events.</p>
         <p>The great majority of images in the the relatively small
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">Subjects Series</ref> (about 120 items) depict scenes from
		  the Revolutionary, Civil, Spanish-American, and World Wars, but other images
		  relate to such diverse subjects as
		  <subject>architecture</subject>,
		  <subject>automobiles</subject>, horses,
		  <subject>ships</subject>, and
		  <subject>politics</subject>. This series includes a large collection of

		  <corpname>Currier and Ives</corpname> prints and American political
		  cartoons.</p>
         <p>The much larger <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">Geographic Series</ref> contains
		  visual representations of many regions in the United States, with the largest
		  concentration belonging to the Southern states. Almost half the series is
		  comprised of images depicting
		  <subject>Civil War</subject> scenes, during and after the war, and are
		  chiefly engravings of battles or photographs of urban devastation. There are
		  very few images of individual soldiers; however, there are reunion group
		  photographs and portraits of Civil War military leaders (many more can be found
		  in the <emph render="bold">People Series</emph>). A few images were taken by
		  noted photographer
		  <persname>Alexander Gardner</persname>. Other photographs and
		  postcards, many from the 19th century, depict factories, buildings and
		  monuments,
		  <subject>street scenes</subject> in cities, social events, and
		  <subject>rural landscapes</subject>. Durham, N.C. is especially
		  well-represented, and many of the locations relate to the
		  <famname>Duke family</famname>.
		  <genreform>Souvenir albums</genreform> and
		  <genreform>postcards</genreform> of
		  <geogname>Florida</geogname>,
		  <geogname>New Orleans</geogname>,
		  <geogname>Niagara Falls</geogname>, and other
		  <subject>tourist destinations</subject> appear frequently. Other
		  geographical locations in this series include many European countries and Asian
		  countries. Particularly of interest are early 20th century images of conflicts
		  in Europe,
		  <geogname>Japan</geogname> and
		  <geogname>China</geogname>.</p>
         <p>The images in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">Socialist Party Records Series</ref> provide a rich additional resource to the papers of the Socialist
		  Party America, also held by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Subdivided into groupings entitled <emph render="bold">General, Geographic, Labor, and
		  People</emph>, the series documents in visual form the history of the party and its
		  membership, chiefly from the early 1900s to the 1970s, with emphasis on the
		  decades from the 1920s through the 1940s. Images include portraits of leading
		  individuals such as Eugene V. Debs, and photographs taken at many conventions
		  and meetings throughout the U.S. Other scenes depicted include strikes,
		  protests, and elections.</p>
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">People Series</ref> is the largest series,
		  comprising nearly two-thirds of the collection. Portraits of well-known
		  military, political, literary, religious, and historical figures from Western
		  society are depicted chiefly through engravings, though there are many
		  photographs of modern figures; all are arranged in alphabetical order. Confederate Civil War military figures are well represented. Subdivisions house images of Native Americans and African
		  Americans, chiefly in photographs and postcards; the older and outdated series
		  titles, Negroes and Indians, have been retained, but cross references have been
		  provided using modern terms Native Americans and African Americans.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Collection Arrangement Note:</emph>

         <p>To allow for better housing, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">negatives</ref>,
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">stereographs</ref>, and <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="">cased images</ref> such as daguerreotypes have been separated into
		  their own series. </p>
         <p>Oversize
		  materials separated from the main collection at processing are housed in flat
		  oversize boxes and appear listed in subseries at the end of each of the main
		  series to which they belong. Cross-references to all separated
		  materials are provided at the original folder locations from which items have
		  been removed. Another large group of oversize materials separated earlier in
		  the collection's history is listed in a separate series at the end of this
		  finding aid; these items are housed in large oversize boxes belonging to the
		  Special Collections Library's on-site oversize box run, and the largest are
		  housed in the library's oversize cabinets. </p>
         <p>To facilitate access to all of the

               <p>Visual materials from a wide range of geographic locations
				separated into subseries. More than half of the subseries and materials are of
				various U.S. states, mostly on the Eastern seaboard. The majority of the U.S.
				material comes from the assorted subseries of the southern states, the largest
				of which are
				<geogname>Georgia</geogname>,
				<geogname>North Carolina</geogname> and
				<geogname>South Carolina</geogname>. Much of the North Carolina
				subseries features historical images of
				<geogname>Durham</geogname>, including a good deal of material
				focusing on the
				<subject>Bennett House</subject>, where
				<persname>General Johnston </persname> surrendered to
				<persname>General Sherman</persname> in 1865. Internationally, the
				Geographic Series includes images from many different nations from around the
				world, ranging from
				<geogname>Bolivia </geogname> to
				<geogname>China</geogname> to
				<geogname>England</geogname>; the most extensive of these
				international subseries are of European countries. The largest of these
				non-U.S. subseries concerns the travels of
				<persname>Robert Tracy Zimmerman</persname> in the
				<geogname>Mediterranean</geogname> area. The vast majority of the
				images in this series are of various landmarks and vistas in the featured
				states and countries. Most of these pictures of historical or geographic
				locales do not include people, but there are a significant number of street
				scenes and the like with many unidentified individuals. Images in this series
				are mostly photographs and
				<genreform>engravings </genreform>, though there are
				<genreform>lithographs</genreform>,
				<genreform>paper prints</genreform>,
				<genreform>clippings</genreform>,
				<genreform>albums</genreform>, and
				<genreform>postcards</genreform> as well. One of the more unusual
				genres is the “Illustrated Florida” collection of chromolithographs with
				identical slides in the
				<geogname>Florida</geogname> subseries. In addition, some items
				were separated from the main collection to allow for better housing; these
				include
				<genreform>negatives</genreform>,
				<genreform>stereographs</genreform>, and
				<genreform>oversized materials</genreform>. All subgroupings and
				items arranged alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Separated from the Socialist Party Records, held by the Rare Book,
				Manuscripts, and Special Collections Library, these visual materials concern
				American and occasionally international
				<subject>Socialism</subject> in the 20th century, with occasional
				forays into the late 1800s. Organized into the following subseries: General,
				Geographic, Labor, and People. The General Subseries consists of images
				depicting a variety of subjects, ranging from
				<subject>Civil Rights</subject> protests in the U.S. to news photographs of the

				<subject>Nazi</subject> military buildup in the early 1930s. The
				contents of the much smaller Geographic and Labor Subseries depict locales of
				interest such as <geogname>Berlin</geogname> and <geogname>Chicago</geogname>, and various labor strikes in the 1940s and
				1950s, respectively. The largest subseries, People, contains portraits of
				various socialist leaders throughout the party’s history (both national and
				regional), with a large amount of material focusing on the life of five-time
				U.S. presidential candidate
				<persname>Eugene V. Debs</persname>. Also included in this
				subseries are groups of socialist legislators as well as assembled socialist
				conventions and delegations. The vast majority of the images in this series
				portray various events and individuals in Socialist Party history; however,
				there are also a few items which depict places of socialist interest, such as
				the city of
				<geogname>Vienna</geogname> or the party headquarters in
				<geogname>Chicago</geogname>. Images in this series are chiefly
				photographic; other formats include
				<genreform>handbills</genreform>,
				<genreform> clippings</genreform>,
				<genreform>sketches</genreform>, black-and-white illustrations, a
				<genreform>viewbook</genreform>, and
				<genreform>postcards</genreform>. In addition, this series features
				an unusual genre in the pair of
				<genreform>duotone plates</genreform> found in the People
				subseries. As in the other series, some items were separated from the main
				collection to allow for better housing; these include
				<genreform>negatives</genreform>, stereographs, and
				<genreform>oversized materials</genreform>. All items arranged
				alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Making up about two-thirds of the Picture File collection, the
				People Series contains images of individuals and groups from many historical
				periods, separated into alphabetical subseries to facilitate access. The
				individuals depicted in this series come from widely different backgrounds,
				ranging from an unnamed peddler with his pack to famous
				<subject> Shakespearean actors</subject>. However, the
				majority of the images depict prominent American and European (mostly British)
				men, such as political and/or military leaders, clergymen, and nobles. A large
				portion of the American individuals portrayed in this series are Civil War
				commanders, both Union and Confederate. The
				<famname>Duke</famname> family of
				<geogname>Durham, NC</geogname> is also well-represented in the
				material. In addition to the alphabetical subseries, arranged chiefly by last
				names, this series also contains two much smaller subseries focused
				specifically on
				<subject>Native Americans</subject>) and
				<subject>African Americans</subject>. The terms "Negroes" and
				"Indians" as used in the original Picture File collection have been retained
				for series titles as representative of the language used in their time;
				cross-references have been added within the box lists under "African Americans"
				and "Native Americans."</p>
               <p>Individual portraits make up the vast majority of items in this
				series. While most of these pictures are posed, there is a significant number
				of informal images as well as large gatherings of unidentified people.
				photographs and engravings make up the largest group of formats in the series,
				though there are also lithographs,
				<genreform>photostats</genreform>,
				<genreform>clippings</genreform>, various printed
				<genreform>illustrations</genreform>,
				<genreform>tintypes</genreform>,
				<genreform>handbills</genreform>,
				<genreform>broadsides</genreform>,
				<genreform>sketches</genreform>, and
				<genreform>postcards</genreform>. Some of the more unusual genres
				include a
				souvenir menu and a page from a
				<genreform>scrapbook</genreform>. In addition, some items were
				separated from the main collection to allow for better housing; these include
				<genreform>cased images</genreform>,
				<genreform>negatives</genreform>, stereographs, and
				<genreform>oversized materials</genreform>. All items are arranged
				alphabetically (the subseries "Negroes" and "Indians" are found within this
				alphabetical order).</p>

               <p>This series contains large-format visual materials removed from
				the Picture File over the last two decades and housed for preservation purposes
				in the library's on-site Oversize Box Run and in the Oversize Cabinets. Formats
				mainly include photographs, engravings and lithographs (all both colored and
				uncolored); but
				<genreform>clippings</genreform>,
				<genreform>illustrations</genreform>, albums, a
				<genreform>sketch</genreform>, and a
				<genreform>handbill</genreform> are also present. The subject
				matter of this material is diverse, ranging from nineteenth century
				<subject>political cartoons</subject> to
				<subject>American Socialist Party</subject> conventions.
				Significant groups of engravings, many commemorating wartime events or figures,
				were produced by
				<corpname>Currier and Ives</corpname>,
				<corpname>L. Prang and Co.</corpname>, and
				<corpname>Kurz and Allison</corpname>. The materials in these
				separate oversize locations were organized in the same four series - and
				subseries - found in the main collection (Subjects, Geographic, Socialist Party
				Records, and People), with some variations. Geographic Series images are in
				the majority. <subject>Civil War</subject> and
				<subject>Political Cartoons</subject> groupings also feature a wide
				variety of images. Individual item entries are arranged in box and cabinet
				number sequence. Within groupings, items are arranged roughly in alphabetical
				order. However, series and sub-groupings are not necessarily in the same order
				as series in main collection. For rapid searching, keywords are most effective.</p>
