         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Reynolds Price Papers</emph> span the years
		  1927-2010, with the bulk of the papers being dated between 1956 and 2004. The
		  collection consists of correspondence; writings by Price and other authors;
		  printed material (including serials containing articles by and about Price and
		  his work as well as newspaper and magazine clippings); legal and financial
		  papers; speeches and addresses; interviews; photographs; audiovisual materials;
		  digital materials; and other material relating to Price's personal life and
		  career as a writer and a teacher, especially at Duke University. Although the
		  correspondence does provide insight into his career as an English professor,
		  the collection contains only a small amount of material, such as lecture notes
		  and syllabi, relating to the courses he taught. Extensive personal and
		  professional correspondence between Price and his family, friends, and fellow
		  authors provides insight into his education at Duke University (particularly
		  his studies with Professor William Blackburn of the Department of English); his
		  period abroad as a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford; and his literary
		  work.</p>
         <p>Many forms of Price's writings (manuscripts, typescripts, stages of
		  proofs with notes, and outlines) document his development of well-known and
		  critically-acclaimed works in a variety of genres: the novels 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Long and Happy Life</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Kate Vaiden;</title> the Biblical translations
		collected in 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Palpable God;</title> the memoirs 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Clear Pictures</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Whole New Life;</title> the two career
		retrospective volumes published in the 1990s, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Collected Stories</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Collected Poems;</title> and many other books
		and individual stories, poems, and essays. In addition to Price's own work,
		numerous American authors--particularly Southern writers--and several British
		authors are represented in the collection. Among the major correspondents are
		Eudora Welty, Stephen Spender, and Allan Gurganus. Some manuscripts sent to
		Price by students and by other authors have notations and criticism by
		Price.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> is
		  divided into the <emph render="bold">General Correspondence Subseries</emph>
		  and the <emph render="bold">Authors' Correspondence Subseries.</emph> The
		  General Correspondence Series consists of letters to and from Price.
		  Correspondents include family, friends, teachers, and admirers of his work.
		  Early letters vividly depict his relationships with family members and friends.
		  Many of the letters dated between 1954 and 1958 concern his education at Duke
		  University and as a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford University. His
		  early development as an author is documented here as well as in the Writings
		  Series. From 1961 onward, letters also provide information about his career as
		  a professor at Duke University. The Authors' Correspondence Subseries comprises
		  correspondence between Price and other writers and literary figures. These
		  letters concern both personal and literary matters. Frequently the
		  correspondents commented on each other's recent publications or on work in
		  progress. Numerous letters to and from Eudora Welty and Stephen Spender reveal
		  much about their strong influence on Price's development as a writer. The
		  series also contains a great many letters from Allan Gurganus, Jeff Humphries,
		  Josephine Humphreys, Joe Porter, Lee Smith, and William Blackburn. </p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> is divided
		  into the <emph render="bold">Writings by Price Subseries</emph> and the
		  <emph render="bold">Writings by Others Subseries.</emph> The former is
		  comprised chiefly of drafts, typescripts, and proofs of Price's novels, plays,
		  autobiographical works, and volumes of poetry, many with Price's notations and
		  revisions, and provides a thorough representation of the development of each.
		  Individual poems, short stories, essays, articles, and reviews by Price are
		  also included. Manuscripts (some of them photocopies) sent to Price by fellow
		  authors and by students make up the <emph render="bold">Writings by Others
		  Subseries.</emph> A few of these include commentary by Price. Both published
		  and unpublished works of poetry and prose are included. A few bibliographies of
		  Price's work are arranged at the end of this series.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Material Series</emph> is divided into
		  the <emph render="bold">Serials Subseries,</emph> the <emph render="bold">Clippings Subseries,</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous Printed Material Subseries (RESTRICTED).</emph> The
		  Serials Subseries is an extensive collection of publications containing
		  articles, reviews, fiction, and poetry by Price as well as articles about him,
		  interviews with him, and reviews of his work. The Clippings Subseries is
		  composed predominantly of reviews of Price's works and other articles about
		  him, but also contains some interviews and short nonfiction work by him, mainly
		  book reviews. Other printed materials documenting Price's achievements, his
		  education, and performances of his dramatic work as well as his speaking
		  engagements are housed in the Miscellaneous Printed Material Subseries.</p>
         <p>Several smaller series make up the remainder of the collection. The
		  <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial Papers Series (RESTRICTED)</emph>
		  contains Price's personal financial data as well as documentation of his
		  writing career through contracts and royalty statements. Transcripts of his
		  speeches and interviews appear in the <emph render="bold">Speeches and
		  Addresses Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> and in the <emph render="bold">Interviews
		  Series (RESTRICTED).</emph> The <emph render="bold">Personal Papers Series
		  (RESTRICTED)</emph> contains a small selection of materials about Price and his
		  family history, including some of his drawings, and his teaching career in the
		  Duke University English Department is documented by the <emph render="bold">Academic Files Series (RESTRICTED).</emph> The
		  <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> touches
		  upon both his personal and professional life; of particular interest here are a
		  number of photographs of Eudora Welty, a friend of Price's since his
		  undergraduate days. The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series
		  (RESTRICTED)</emph> contains audio and video recordings of a variety of public
		  appearances, including readings, speeches, awards ceremonies, and interviews on
		  various local and national radio and television programs. A small
		  <emph render="bold">Electronic Formats Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> contains
		  files that supplement materials in other series, mainly Price's writings and
		  some correspondence.</p>
         <p>Finally, of special note is a large collection of <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials (RESTRICTED)</emph> that supplements material
		  found in most of the major series. This part of the collection is particularly
		  rich in one area, and should not be overlooked by scholars researching the
		  writing, editing and publishing process of any of Price's books up through the
		  early 1990s. The significance of that date lies in the increasing use of
		  photographic and electronic media in the publishing industry. Prior to this
		  time, many of the various kinds of long galley proofs historically used by
		  publishers are housed with the Oversize Materials; after this period, most
		  proofs are printed on legal or even letter-sized paper and can thus be found
		  with the main body of the <emph render="bold">Writings by Price Series.</emph>

         <p>Materials related to the life and career of Reynolds Price appear in
		  several other collections housed at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. The <emph render="bold">Clear Pictures Film Footage
		  Collection</emph> houses materials created and used by Charles Guggenheim in
		  making his 1994 documentary film about Price's life (based on Price's own 1989
		  memoir of the same title). The collection includes many materials that do not
		  appear in the published version of the film: research, film footage of
		  interviews of and about Price, and electronic files. Documentation of Price's
		  professional writing career appears in the records of the <emph render="bold">Harriet Wasserman Literary Agency Records. </emph> Materials
		  there include correspondence, drafts and published versions of his works, and
		  publishing contracts both with this agency and with Russell and Volkening,
		  Wasserman's employer prior to forming her own agency. Extensive documentation
		  of Price's publishing history can be found in the <emph render="bold">Jody
		  Jones Hunter Collection of Works by Reynolds Price.</emph> In addition to
		  copies of Price's books with major commercial publishers, the Hunter collection
		  also contains many small press publications, limited editions, periodicals, and
		  audiovisual materials. Finally, the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library contains copies of many publications similar to those in
		  the Hunter collection. These items, cataloged separately from the Reynolds
		  Price Papers, are searchable by individual title in the Duke University
		  Libraries online catalog. </p>

				  1993. Thus, although undated per se, they are known to date prior to 1993 or
				  earlier. The undated letters in Box GC56 at the end of the subseries, on the
				  other hand, have been received by the library from Price since the mid-1990s;

                  <p>The majority of Price's published books and plays (minus some
				  small press publications and limited editions) appear in order of publication
				  date in boxes WP1-WP70. For each book, materials are then arranged in order of
				  their writing and editing history. In cases of approximate or inferred dates,
				  strict chronological order is occasionally ignored, with the main sequence of
				  writing and editing the text--as reflected in notes, manuscripts, typescripts,
				  and proofs--being favored over such later matters in the publication process as
				  jacket copy, ads, and adaptations into other genres and media (such as
				  screenplays and audiobooks).</p>
                  <p>Materials for individual short works appear in the last six
				  boxes of the subseries, WP71-WP77, in four categories: uncollected poems,
				  uncollected stories, uncollected nonfiction, and student work. The first three
				  of these groups are arranged alphabetically by title; Price's student work,
				  from high school through his years at Oxford, is arranged chronologically.</p>
