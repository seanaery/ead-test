An avid amateur street photographer influenced by Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt, and Louis Stettner, Reis focused his camera on street scenes in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East during the 1960s. The images capture the anti-war demonstrations of the time while also documenting the quotidian life of urban neighborhoods, street markets, and other public spaces such as Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park and New York City's Washington Square. The black-and-white gelatin silver prints range in size from 8x10-inch contact sheets to 11x14-inch finished prints. Other materials include manuscript and printed materials such as an early curriculum vitae, some correspondence, exhibition fliers, articles, and photo essays.

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Ronald Reis began taking photographs as a child with an Argus A2. He shot sports photography in junior high school with an Argus C-3 and an Ansco Reflex. He continued photographing sports, acquiring cameras, and developing his darkroom skills throughout high school. When he moved to Philadelphia in 1953 to attend the University of Pennsylvania, Reis turned his 35mm Leica from the sports fields to the streets.</p>
         <p>Influenced by the work of Helen Levitt, Louis Stettner, and Cartier-Bresson, Reis became a passionate street photographer, honing his ability to compose and capture photographs on the fly. This decisive quality is reflected in his contacts sheets filled with single exposures. Reis primarily photographed in New York, Connecticut and Europe during the 1960s. The collection captures the look and feel of the 1960s, especially in the cities of New York City and London. </p>
         <p>Reis's photographic work has been exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum, Dartmouth College, the A.T. Gallery in New Haven Connecticut, the New Britain Museum of American Art, the E. Leitz Gallery in New York, and the Image Gallery in New York. In addition, several of his prints were exhibited, as the only amateur photographer, in a Christmas show at the Witkin Gallery in New York City as well as in a one-man show at Parents Magazine Gallery in New York City. His work has been published in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Camera 35</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Leica Magazine</title>, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Popular Photography</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">U.S. Camera</title>. Permanent collections of his images reside at Duke University's Rubenstein Library, in the Worcester Art Museum (Worcester, Massachusetts), the Museum of American Art in New Britain, Connecticut, and the British Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.</p>
         <p>Ronald Reis continues to photograph on the street using digital cameras and now prints in color as well as black-and-white.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Ronald Reis Photographs collection contains 289 black-and-white photographs, accompanied by negatives and contact sheets, of documentary images taken by Reis during the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in Connecticut, London, and New York City, with a smaller number from Athens, Barcelona, Como, Dublin, Florence, Jerusalem, London, Rome, and Venice.  An avid amateur street photographer influenced by Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt, and Louis Stettner, Reis focused his camera on street scenes in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East during the 1960s. The images capture the anti-war demonstrations of the time while also documenting the quotidian life of urban neighborhoods, street markets, and other public spaces.  Favorite locations chosen by Reis and portrayed in a multiplicity of scenes include London's Hyde Park Speakers' Corner, Portobello flea market, and Trafalgar Square; New York's Bryant Park, Greenwich Village, and Washington Square; and market scenes in Connecticut and Jerusalem. Other images portray anti-Vietnam War protests in Bryant Park, parades, amusement parks, and other street scenes.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged in three series: <emph render="bold">Photographs, Negatives</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Manuscript and Print Materials</emph>.  The black-and-white gelatin silver prints range in size from 8x10-inch contact sheets to 11x14 finished prints. Other materials include manuscript and printed materials such as an early curriculum vita, some correspondence, exhibition fliers, negative sleeves, articles, and photo essays.  Prints and contact sheets are organized by chronological date (year and month) of the shoot, with a few exceptions where only the decade is known. Contact sheets are followed by the selected prints from the same roll.</p>
         <p>Each contact sheet has an identifier derived by the photographer from the roll id, which in most cases notes the month and year plus a letter code (e.g., 6/1962G or 07-1962F). Each print also is identified by the roll id followed by a numeral (6/1962G-01). A few rolls are identified by decade only.</p>
         <p>The negatives in the collection have been arranged by year and month, and have been labeled from original notes on the negative envelopes. They overlap with the prints in the collection to some degree, but there are also negatives for images that are not currently present in the photographic prints.</p>
         <p>Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

               <p>Series contains 66 envelopes containing 35 mm negatives and 13 envelopes of 120 mm negatives; each envelope holds one roll of film cut into strips.  Images correspond to locales of prints in the collection, including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York City, and various countries in Europe, especially England (London), Greece, and Italy.  There are also images from a trip to Jerusalem in the 1970s.  Also among the images are Vietnam protest marches and other demonstrations, as well as early street scenes from urban areas and shots taken at an amusement park in Connecticut, Savin Rock.</p>
               <p>The negatives are arranged chronologically by year and month, and within by location and strip letter id, with undated items at the end of the series.  Titles are taken from notes on the original envelopes.  Some negatives represent images not currently among the prints or contact sheets.</p>
