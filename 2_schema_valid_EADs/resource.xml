         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The records of the Resource Center for Women and Ministry in the South
span the years 1939 to 2008 with the bulk occurring from 1977 to 1990. The
Resource Center's mission of working for justice in the South as well as its
operations are reflected in the records, which primarily consist of printed
material, correspondence, writings, clippings, account books, grant proposals,
minutes, newsletters, photographs, audio tapes, filmstrips, and videocassette
tapes.</p>
         <p>The Resource Center for Women and Ministry in the South Records are
especially relevant to the study of the relationships among religion, politics and
society. In particular they document how women, especially women in ministry,
have confronted a number of social issues facing the South as well as the entire
United States. Information pertaining to the Equal Rights Amendment, sexism,
feminism, economic justice and poverty, gays and lesbians in the Church, Central
America, child abuse, abortion and the abortion controversy, racism, and rural
ministry is included in the records. Information on these issues as well as others
is contained in the Alphabetical Files and Printed Material series. Retreats and
conferences, some organized by the Resource Center for Women and Ministry in
the South, which focus on many of the above issues as well as other concerns,
including gender and language, spirituality, housing and homelessness, women in
ministry, health and medical care, and women in the workplace are reflected in
the Alphabetical Files, Audiovisual, and Pictures series. Many of these retreats
and conferences were held in North Carolina and Virginia. In the Printed
Material Series, are copies of South of the Garden, a newsletter published by the
Resource Center, resource packets pertaining to sexism and ministries to women
in crisis among other subjects, and a number of religious newsletters that focus
on women in the Church.</p>
         <p>The records reflect the ecumenical vision of the Resource Center in that the major Protestant denominations are represented in the records. Within these denominations, women's organizations
are the primary focus, including the Presbyterian Committee on Women's Concerns, the National
Association of Presbyterian Clergy Women, and the United Church of Christ Clergywomen's
Conference. Other religious bodies and organizations reflected in the records include the North
Carolina Council of Churches - Committee for ERA, Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, and
programs for women at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Material pertaining to
these organizations are primarily located in the Alphabetical Files; Financial Papers; Meetings,
Conferences, and Workshops; and Printed Material series.</p>
         <p>Significant individuals reflected in the records, primarily within the Audiovisual Series,
include Rosemary Radford Ruether, Anne Wilson Schaef, Katie Cannon, and Carter Heyward.
The correspondence, writings, sermons and addresses, and notes of Jeanette Stokes, Director of
the Resource Center for Women and Ministry in the South, are chiefly contained in the Financial
Papers; Meetings, Conferences, and Workshops; and Audiovisual series. Documents concerning
the operations and history of the Resource Center, including account books, grant proposals, and
incorporation materials are primarily located in the Financial Papers and Miscellaneous
Series.</p>
