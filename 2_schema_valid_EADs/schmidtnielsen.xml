         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Knut Schmidt-Nielsen Papers span the years 1939-1994, documenting
		  the life and work of this prominent animal physiologist and educator. Formats
		  include correspondence, research notes, field data, published material,
		  lectures, memos, reports, grant applications, and other materials.
		  Schmidt-Nielsen spent most of his career at Duke University where he served on
		  faculty from 1952 to 1995, studying comparative animal physiology and
		  environmental conditions in the desert, particularly in the Sahara and North
		  Africa, with a particular interest in the camel. In addition, Schmidt-Nielsen
		  was active as a lecturer and as a member of various biological organizations,
		  including the International Union of Physiological Sciences and the Interunion
		  Commission on Comparative Physiology, as well as being heavily involved with
		  the publication of <emph render="italic">News in Physiological Sciences</emph>.
		  Also documented is Schmidt-Nielsen's active role as teacher and advisor, and
		  his involvement in the Duke University Nixon Library Committee. The collection
		  is divided into the following series: Animal Physiology Research,
		  Correspondence, Engagements, Graduate Student, International Union of
		  Physiological Sciences, <emph render="italic">News in Physiological
		  Sciences</emph>, Publications, and Subject Files.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Animal Physiology Research Notes Series</emph>
		  contains materials from Schmidt-Nielsen's research trip to the Sahara in 1953
		  and 1954, including correspondence, data, and journal entries. The
		  <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> is by far the largest in the
		  collection, and contains both official professional correspondence as well as
		  scientific discussions and other related material. Much of the early
		  correspondence is in Norwegian. The <emph render="bold">Engagements
		  Series</emph> documents lectures given by Schmidt-Nielsen from throughout his
		  career, including lecture notes, slides, and diagrams. Schmidt-Nielsen's
		  teaching work is documented in the <emph render="bold">Graduate Student
		  Series</emph>, chiefly his interactions with graduate student advisees. The
		  <emph render="bold">International Union of Physiological Sciences Series</emph>
		  houses materials from Schmidt-Nielsen's involvement with this organization, of
		  which he was president from 1980 to 1986. The series includes minutes, memos,
		  reports, correspondence, and other related materials. The <emph render="bold">
               <emph render="italic">News in Physiological Sciences</emph>
		  Series</emph> consists of material related to the publication of this journal.
		  In the <emph render="bold">Publications Series</emph>, there are copies of
		  nearly every article Schmidt-Nielsen published. The
		  <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> contains miscellaneous material
		  grouped by subject regarding organizations, grant applications, and topics in
		  animal research. Another small series, the <emph render="bold">Translations Series</emph> houses 33 published translations of a selection of Schmidt-Nielsen's textbooks. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Series</emph> houses three sound recordings of conference talks given by Schmidt-Nielsen during the 1960s. Original recordings are closed to use; please contact Research Services staff concerning access.</p>
         <p>Unprocessed addition (2006-0026) (11,468 items, 18 lin. ft.; dated
		  1902-2003) comprises personal and professional correspondence, subject and
		  genealogy files, lecture notes, calendars, clippings, and photographs. The
		  addition is not represented in the finding aid, but a preliminary inventory is available on request. For research access, please contact the Research Services staff.</p>

               <p>Includes scientific inquiries and invitations; professional
				correspondence with colleagues, researchers, publishers, and graduate students;
				and letters of recommendation. Interspersed in the series are vitae and
				statements of plans, grant application materials, copyright releases, requests
				for plant and animal samples, occasional newpaper clippings, photographs, and
				postcards. The 1948-1952 correspondence with the Office of Naval Research
				contains grant application files. Correspondence from Schmidt-Nielsen's stay in
				Algeria in 1953-1954 documents logistics and field work during the trip. Duke
				University correspondence includes records of departmental procedures, graduate
				students documentation, and requests for lab equipment. An extensive portion of
				the early correspondence is in Norwegian; occasional documents are in French,
				German, or Spanish. The folders are labelled and arranged alphabetically by
				last name or subject. Additional professional correspondence can be found in
				other series, particularly the International Union of Physiological Sciences
				and the <emph render="italic">News in Physiological Sciences</emph> Series.</p>

               <p>Contains records of Schmidt-Nielsen's participation in scientific
				meetings and conferences, as well as individual lectures and presentations. A
				large part of the series is comprised of Schmidt-Nielsen's lecture notes,
				diagrams, and slides; complete drafts of presentations are less common.
				Subjects of the lectures include: physiology and adaptations of desert animals;
				breathing and locomotion; and scaling and size in biology. Also included are
				conference-related materials, such as correspondence, brochures, and posters.
				Extensive material is available for the conference on Scaling in Biology held
				at Duke University in 1973. Interspersed through the series are records from
				the annual International Conference on Comparative Physiology. A few documents
				are in French, German, Japanese, and Norwegian. Folders are labelled by date of
				event and topic, and are arranged chronologically by month of the year. A
				separate folder at the end of the series contains a complete chronological list
				of lectures given by Schmidt-Nielsen. </p>
