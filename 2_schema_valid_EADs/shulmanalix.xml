The primary focus of the collection is Shulman's writing and literary career. The secondary focus is the women's liberation and feminist movements, in which Shulman was and continues to be very active (from 1968 to 2000). However, feminism and feminist activism are inextricably intertwined with Shulman's writing career, and her 1972 novel MEMOIRS OF AN EX-PROM QUEEN is regarded by many as the first novel to "come out of" the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Alix Kates Shulman (given name Alix Audrey Kates)
		  was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1932 to Dorothy Davis Kates
		  and Samuel Kates. Raised in suburban Cleveland Heights, she
		  graduated from Case Western Reserve University in 1953 with
		  a degree in English and History. She moved to New York City
		  after college and began graduate studies at Columbia
		  University where she met and married fellow graduate
		  student Marcus Klein in 1954. After marriage she began a
		  series of research, editorial and writing jobs. She and
		  Klein were divorced in 1958, and she then married Martin
		  Shulman in 1959. She gave birth to her son Ted in 1961 and
		  to her daughter Polly in 1963. </p>
         <p>Shulman became involved in the early women's
		  liberation movement groups in New York City in the late
		  1960s. She participated in the famed Miss America Pageant
		  Protest in Atlantic City in 1968, was an early member of
		  the groups <emph render="doublequote">Redstockings</emph> and
		  <emph render="doublequote">WITCH</emph> in 1969, and joined the
		  <emph render="doublequote">New York Radical Women</emph> in
		  1970. At approximately the same time she became active in
		  the women's liberation movement, Shulman began her literary
		  career, publishing articles in both feminist and mainstream
		  periodicals, and publishing a number of children's books
		  and non-fiction books about Emma Goldman. She and Martin
		  Shulman drafted a 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Marriage Agreement</title>
		which was published in the feminist journal 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Up From Under</title> in 1970.
		The 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Agreement</title> was
		re-printed with accompanying articles in 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Redbook</title> (in 1971) and
		then in 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Life</title> (1972). Due to
		these re-printings, the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Agreement</title> received
		much press and raised much controversy. It was attacked by,
		among others, Norman Mailer and Russell Baker. Also in
		1972, Shulman published her first major (and
		semi-autobiographical) novel, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Memoirs of an Ex-Prom
		  Queen.</title>
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Memoirs</title> became a
		national best seller, raised much debate about the growing
		feminist movement and the situation of women in U.S.
		society, and launched Shulman's writing career on a
		national level. </p>
         <p>Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Shulman
		  continued to work as a feminist activist, to write essays
		  and short stories for a wide variety of journals and
		  newspapers, to teach and present speeches and conference
		  papers, and to publish novels and memoirs. She divorced
		  Martin Shulman in 1985 and married former Cleveland Heights
		  High School classmate Scott York in 1989. Her two most
		  recently published books are 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Drinking the Rain</title>
		(1995), an account of her solitary, non-technological life
		on a Maine island, and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Good Enough Daughter</title>
		(1999), a memoir focusing on her relationships with her
		late parents. She received an honorary doctorate of Humane
		Letters from Case Western Reserve University in 2001.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The materials in the Alix Kates Shulman Papers
		  span the dates 1892 to 2000, with the bulk of materials
		  dating from 1968 to 2000. These materials include:
		  manuscripts, notes, clippings, published books,
		  correspondence, photographs, audio and videotapes,
		  microfilm, address and date books, family and business
		  records. The primary focus of the collection is Shulman's
		  writing and literary career. The secondary focus is the
		  women's liberation and feminist movements, in which Shulman
		  was and continues to be very active (from 1968 to the
		  present). However, feminism and feminist activism are
		  inextricably intertwined with Shulman's writing career, and
		  her 1972 novel 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Memoirs of an Ex-Prom
		  Queen</title> is regarded by many as the first novel to
		<emph render="doublequote">come out of</emph> the women's
		liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. </p>
         <p>Other topics covered by the collection include:
		  her teaching and other academic work; her public speaking
		  and conference activities; and her involvement in political
		  activities besides feminism. This collection sheds valuable
		  light on the concerns and tensions within the women's
		  liberation and second-wave feminist movements. In
		  particular, the materials document debates and
		  disagreements among those active in the movement with
		  regard to sexuality, marriage and domestic relations,
		  women's financial situation and careers, health care, civil
		  rights and cultural expression. Many of these issues are
		  raised in Shulman's own work, including her novels, essays,
		  short fiction, personal letters and her teaching
		  materials.</p>
         <p>The collection is divided into seven series. The
		  <emph render="bold">Personal Papers Series</emph> contains
		  Shulman's family history papers, photographs, biographical
		  papers, and her personal correspondence (with writers,
		  academics, political activists and family members). Notable correspondents include Ros Baxandall, Jay
		Bolotin, Kay Boyle, Rita Mae Brown, Phyllis Chesler, Judy Chicago, Andrea
		Dworkin, Candace Falk, Marilyn French, Lori Ginzberg,
		Hannah Green, Erica Jong, Kate Millett, Honor Moore, Robin Morgan, Tillie
		Olson, Lillian Rubin, Sue Standing, and Meredith Tax. The
		  <emph render="bold">Political Work Series</emph> contains
		  material relating to Shulman's involvement with feminist
		  and other liberal political groups, including Redstockings,
		  New York Radical Women, the PEN Women's Committee, No More
		  Nice Girls, the Women's Action Coalition, and Women Against
		  Government Surveillance</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Literary Work
		  Series</emph> contains a variety of materials relating to
		  Shulman's literary career, including financial and other
		  dealings with publishing houses, notes and research,
		  photocopies of publications, reviews of her work, articles
		  and notes she collected regarding the literary scene, and
		  original manuscripts. This series contains information
		  about her early children's books; several books she edited
		  of Emma Goldman's writings; her essays and short fiction;
		  her novels 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Memoirs of an Ex-Prom
		  Queen</title> (1972), 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Burning Questions</title>
		(1975), 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">On the Stroll</title> (1977), 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">In Every Woman's Life . . .
		  </title>(1980); and her memoirs 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Drinking the Rain</title>
		(1995) and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">A Good Enough Daughter</title>
		(1999). A small amount of correspondence regarding book reviews of other authors' work is also included.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Academic Work
		  Series</emph> contains materials relating to Shulman's
		  graduate work at NYU; her teaching at Yale, the University
		  of Colorado at Boulder, NYU, and the University of Hawaii
		  at Manoa; as well as her relationships with her students.
		  The <emph render="bold">Public Speaking Series</emph>
		  contains materials relating to Shulman's participation in
		  literary and political conferences and gatherings, personal
		  interviews, lectures and book talks. </p>
         <p>Portions of the <emph render="bold">Restricted
		  Materials Series</emph> either may not be photocopied

				Series, 1892-2000,</emph> is comprised of three subseries.
				The Family History Subseries contains correspondence,
				financial papers, articles, and other documents concerning
				Shulmans parents' families--the Kates and the Davis
				families. Some of this material concerns her Jewish
				ancestry, her parent's professional and political
				activities (her father was a lawyer and her mother a
				writer), financial papers, photos, diaries and other
				materials relating to her family's extensive travels.
				Materials in the Biographical Subseries relate to Shulman's
				own personal history, including journals and datebooks,
				newspaper clippings, notes and correspondence with family,
				friends, and professional acquaintances. The Correspondence
				Subseries contains letters on a wide variety of topics,
				including Shulman's friends and family relations, her
				writing career, her political work, and other social and
				cultural activities. Material in the Family History
				Subseries and the Biographical Subseries is arranged
				alphabetically by the folder titles assigned by Shulman
				with miscellaneous material appearing at the end of the
				subseries. Material in the Correspondence Subseries is

               <p>The Restricted Series contains three
				  categories of restricted materials:</p>
               <p>1. Materials which cannot be photocopied nor
				  electronically scanned without the permission of Alix Kates
				  Shulman or the author of the material. </p>
               <p>2. Materials which cannot be read without
				  the permission of Alix Kates Shulman.</p>
               <p>3. Materials which cannot be opened until
				  2023, the death of Alix Kates Shulman, or the death of the
				  author, whichever comes last. </p>
               <p>Each of these restrictions comprises its own
				  subseries. Additionally, the attempt has been made to
				  recreate as closely as possible the same organization
				  within these restricted subseries as was used in the
				  unrestricted materials, so to facilitate researchers' use
				  of overlapping and related materials--especially those
				  under Restriction 1. Thus, each series contains
				  sub-subseries such as <emph render="doublequote">Personal
				  Papers,</emph>
                  <emph render="doublequote">Political Work,</emph>
                  <emph render="doublequote">Literary Work,</emph>
                  <emph render="doublequote">Academic Work,</emph> and
