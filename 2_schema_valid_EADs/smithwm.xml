         <p>William Smith, M. P. (1756-1835), was an important figure in English
		  politics for about 50 years. He was interested in many reform measures. This
		  collection of 240 Items is concerned primarily with his activities relative to
		  the abolition of West Indian slavery, although there are a few Items outside of
		  this area.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Among the 100 letters in this collection there are many of
		  considerable interest and importance. Outstanding are the 24 letters of William
		  Wilberforce (1759-1833); these discuss such topics as: religion, sickness in
		  the family, his sickness which forced him to leave the House of Commons, his
		  family and his desire for more private life with them, his relatives, political
		  disappointments, trips and engagements, publishers, criminals in Great Britain
		  and their punishment, resolutions and plans for the abolition of slavery, the
		  antl-slavery society, the Jamaica Law, Spanish slave trade, Spanish abolition,
		  William Pitt, Lord Grenville and his estate <emph render="italic">Dropmore,</emph> Dr. Channing, Robert Hall, and Thomas Buxton.
		  There is a 10-page typescript which gives excerpts and summaries of the
		  Wilberforce letters included with the collection. Three of the letters are
		  fragmentary.</p>
         <p>A number of the letters from Smith's many correspondents stand out.
		  There are a number of letters around 1790 from various societies and committees
		  discussing the abolition of slavery and approving Smith's actions; some of them
		  mention Wilberforce, also. A letter from J. Yule in Edinburgh of August 13,
		  1792, tells of the poor Scottish peasants who are being driven from their lands
		  to make room for sheep which are more profitable. Three letters from James Muir
		  between 1793 and 1797 discuss the case of his son who has been banished for
		  fourteen years for Joining the Society for Parliamentary Reform. A letter from
		  John Longley on January 31, 1796, tells of a book which he has just published
		  on parliamentary reform and discusses various aspects of the English government
		  from the viewpoint of a reformer. Thomas Coke on March 16, 1809, writes of the
		  different slavery laws in Jamaica. A lengthy letter from Andrew Wedderburn, a
		  large Jamaica Plantation owner, on November 12, 1813, discusses the condition
		  of the Negroes after a storm, their food supplies, sickness and death, his
		  attitude toward their care, the various uses of the land, the crops raised, the
		  market for produce, the purchase and hiring of slaves. and shipments to
		  England. A number of letters from Bermuda, Nevis, St. Vincent, Barbados, and
		  Berbice contain similar discussions. An unusually good letter comes from a
		  planter in St. Vincent, April 4, 1816. Some of these planters' letters give in
		  rather emphatic terms the case of the planters against the abolition of
		  slavery. There is copy of a sermon preached at Port Royal, Jamaica, June 7,
		  1822, on the anniversary of the great earthquake (1692) which contains a very
		  frank and oven criticism of the moral life of Port Royal.</p>
         <p>One of the most interesting Items in the collection is letter from
		  John Horseman, July 15, 1817, which includes the text of Robert Southey's poem
		  entitled 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">To the Exiled
		  Patriots.</title> The only known publication of the poem is in Samuel Taylor
		Coleridge's 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Essays on His Own Times,</title>
		(1850) I, 19-20. Horseman's edition of the poem contains sixteen stanzas as
		compared to Coleridge's ten. In addition eight of the lines are different in
		the two editions.</p>
         <p>Several letters from Thomas Clarkson in 1825-1827 discuss the methods
		  to be used in the drive for complete abolition of slavery. A letter from T.
		  Gisborne in 1829 accuses Smith of being a Papist. A lengthy petition in 1829
		  signed by 95 <emph render="italic">principal native inhabitants</emph> of
		  Bombay, India, protests to the House of Commons against certain grievances and
		  asks redress. A letter of Gilbert Shelton in Bermuda in 1832 comments with keen
		  insight on the recent Reform Act, on Irish independence, and on the types of
		  Christian missionaries in the West Indies; later letters from him give
		  considerable details regarding the purchase of a life insurance Policy in
		  England. Different letters in 1833 tell of the methods and problems involved in
		  the abolition of slavery. A letter from James Stephen announces Wilberforce's
		  death, July 29, 1833; also a letter from Wilberforce's son, Robert, tells of
		  the death. There is a copy of a petition to Rev. H. W. Wilberforce signed by
		  127 members of both houses of Parliament requesting that William Wilberforce be
		  buried in Westminster Abbey and that they be granted permission to attend the
		  funeral. Several letters between the Clarksons and William Smith shortly offer
		  Wilberforce's death concern Robert Wilberforce's proposed life of his father
		  and his ideas of attacking some of Thomas Clarkson's claims for himself in the
		  abolition movement.</p>

         <p>In addition to the letters mentioned above, there is extensive
		  evidence in the miscellaneous pacers and the printed material on slavery. It
		  includes: spips in the slave trade, deaths on sieve ships, food carried on
		  slave ships, methods of obtaining slaves in Africa, conditions of Negroes in
		  Africa, British exports to Africa, eyewitness accounts and lists of witnesses,
		  general information on the West Indies, estates and plantations, diseases and
		  epidemics, population, treatment of slaves, breeding of slaves versus
		  importation, description of a riot in Barbados in 1823 and the destruction of a
		  Methodist chapel, printed petitions from the West Indies showing the
		  increasingly difficult financial position of the planters due to high taxes,
		  shipping costs, and low prices, lists of West Indian Laws concerning slavery
		  and copies of some, a planter's plan for the emancipation of slaves over a
		  period of 34 years, conditions of slaves in French colonies, papers comparing
		  the raising of sugar cane in the West Indies and in the East Indies and India,
		  letters regarding the abolition of slavery in Ceylon, speeches in Parliament or
		  manuscripts of books, Parliamentary resolutions, printed statements for and
		  against slavery, history of the movement for abolition, newspaper excerpts, and
		  magazine articles.</p>
         <p>The Smith collection is exceedingly valuable both for its mass of
		  excellent material on slavery and for its wealth of material on British
		  politics of this period.</p>

            <emph render="bold">5 Items added, 1-12-61.</emph> This addition
		  consists of two leaflets from the Greek Committee in London and of three
		  letters which are addressed to William Smith - two from Prince Alexander
		  Mavrocordato, an official in the revolutionary Greek government, and one from
		  John Orlando, a Greek Deputy. On June 24, 1823, Mavrocordato asks Smith's
		  support for a mission which the Greeks are sending to England. The Greek
		  emissaries hope to obtain a loan, as well as publicity, for their cause.
		  Mavrocordato also expresses (July 4, 1823) to Smith the appreciation of the
		  Greek government for his efforts in its behalf. Orlando thanks (July 15, 1826)
		  Smith for his held, and he refers to an unspecified decision which is expected
		  from George Canning (?). There are two leaflets from the Greek Committee of
		  which Smith-was a member. One leaflet (4 pp.) contains an address in behalf of
		  the Greek revolutionary cause (May 3, 1823), a list of the members of the Greek
		  Committee, and a list of seven resolutions which were adopted at a public
		  meeting on May 15, 1823. The second leaflet (2 pp. is a request for
		  subscriptions, and it has a long list of subscribers and of the amounts which
		  they donated.</p>
