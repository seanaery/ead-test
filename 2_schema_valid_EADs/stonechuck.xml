		  as editor and columnist at the

		  Between 1965 and 1967 he was special assistant and press secretary to New York
		  representative Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. He served as mediator between the
		  police and suspected criminals for over 20 years, most notably in his
		  negotiation of the Graterford Prison hostage crisis in 1981. He is the author
		  of multiple books, from political analyses to a novel about his time with
		  Powell and (in 2003) a children's book. He was also an educator for many years,
		  as Professor of English at the University of Delaware from 1985-1991 and Walter
		  Spearman Professor of Journalism at UNC-Chapel Hill from 1991 to 2005, when he
		  retired.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Chuck Stone Papers</emph> span the years 1931
		  to 2007. The collection consists of clippings and other print materials,
		  correspondence, writings, scrapbooks, photographs, a videotape, research files,
		  and diplomas and certificates pertaining to the life and career of Chuck Stone.
		  Of the subject areas documented here are Stone's career as a prominent
		  African-American journalist, his political career and relationship with Adam
		  Clayton Powell, Jr. (including Powell's time as head of the Congressional
		  Committee on Education and Labor), his role as a mediator between suspects and
		  the criminal justice system, and his involvement in civil rights struggles in
		  the United States. Also represented, but to a much lesser extent, is his
		  teaching career at the University of Delaware and UNC-Chapel Hill. The
		  collection is divided into nine series, each described below. Of these, the
		  largest by far are the <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph> and the
		  <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series, which document respectively
		  Stone's journalistic writings (especially during his time at the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title>) and his research
		interests over the years, including racial politics in the U.S.,
		African-Americans in the media, the criminal justice system, censorship and
		free speech, and standardized testing. The collection was acquired as part of
		the John Hope Franklin Collection of African and African-American
		Documentation.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series
		  (RESTRICTED)</emph> documents Stone's time as press secretary and special
		  assistant to Powell. It contains office and business correspondence both to and
		  from Stone; clippings and other printed materials about Powell or the
		  <corpname>Committee on Education and Labor</corpname>; office files on
		  individual members of congress (notably Florida Democrat
		  <persname>Sam Gibbons</persname>, partly responsible for the campaign
		  to remove Powell from his position as head of the Committee); files related to
		  the workings of the Committee; press releases written by Stone; and a number of
		  papers relating to Powell's exclusion from Congress in 1967. This series should
		  be useful both for those interested in the career of Powell, since Stone worked
		  for him during a pivotal time in his career, and for those interested in the
		  workings of the Committee on Education and Labor during that time.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> is made up
		  predominantly of Stone's columns from the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title> and the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">NEA Viewpoint</title> (a
		<corpname>Newspaper Enterprise Association</corpname> column syndicated
		by
		<corpname>United Media</corpname>), as well as articles about Stone from
		various newspapers, and some writings by Stone appearing in other newspapers.
		Topics addressed by Stone in his columns include racial politics in the U.S.,
		Philadelphia politics, the media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa, women's
		issues and feminism, the criminal justice system, and standardized testing.
		Researchers interested in Stone's journalism career prior to 1972 will find
		some earlier clippings here, but should consult the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> for more extensive
		materials and clippings from that period.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series (RESTRICTED)</emph>
		  contains correspondence to and from Stone relating to business and personal
		  matters. The majority of this series is made up of general correspondence or
		  correspondence relating to Stone's position as editor and columnist of the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title>. The remainder of
		the series comprises topical folders of correspondence, such as the
		correspondence between Stone and
		<persname>Edward M. Ryder</persname>, an inmate at Graterford Prison.
		Other such correspondence can be found in the "Criminal justice system"
		subsection of the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph>.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Other Writings Series</emph> houses Stone's
		  writings not contained in the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>, such
		  as speeches, sermons, and television transcripts; business documents and
		  research files pertaining to different projects on which Stone worked, such as
		  his attempts to develop his own life or his writings on
		  <persname>Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.</persname> into a movie, or various
		  uncompleted book projects; and a small subset of writings by others, including
		  an autobiography of
		  <persname>Corinne Huff</persname> on which Stone worked. It is divided
		  into three subseries to accommodate the restriction on the collection: the
		  <emph render="bold">Published Writings by Stone Subseries</emph>, the
		  <emph render="bold">Unpublished Writings by Stone Subseries
		  (RESTRICTED)</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Writings by Others Subseries
		  (RESTRICTED)</emph>. Notably absent from this series are manuscripts of Stone's
		  books. Instead, the series contains either shorter published materials, such as
		  publicly delivered speeches, or working documents assembled for the creation of
		  larger works.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series (RESTRICTED)</emph> houses
		  the contents of four scrapbooks assembled by Stone during the 1950s and 1960s.
		  They contain a number of clippings, programs, and some correspondence
		  pertaining to his time at the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Age</title>, the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Washington Afro-American</title>, the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Chicago Defender</title>, and working for Adam
		Clayton Powell, Jr. The series is especially useful for documenting Stone's
		early career and his position as an outspoken African-American journalist and
		defender of civil rights. Researchers interested in this period in Stone's life
		should also consult the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> for more
		materials from the period in question that are not present in the
		scrapbooks.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">St. Louis Series</emph> is a small series
		  housing clippings and correspondence related to Stone's brief position as
		  ombudsman for the
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">St. Louis Post-Disptach</title>, overseeing their
		coverage of the 1997 mayoral election. The series is divided into a
		<emph render="bold">Published Materials Subseries</emph>, which houses
		clippings from the Post-Dispatch and related newspapers, and an
		<emph render="bold">Unpublished Materials Subseries (RESTRICTED)</emph>, in
		which can be found correspondence, business documents, and responses to several
		readers polls conducted by Stone.</p>
         <p>In the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> can be found
		  Stone's research files on different subject areas, arranged alphabetically. The
		  files contain primarily clippings, but also some correspondence and notes.
		  Several subcategories that are heavily represented and should be mentioned are
		  the files on censorship and the first amendment, on the criminal justice
		  system, on standardized testing, and on materials relating to his time at
		  UNC-Chapel Hill. There are also numerous files related to racial politics in
		  the U.S., but these files are less discrete than the categories described above
		  and are to be found throughout the series rather than under a specific
		  subheading.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series (RESTRICTED)</emph>
		  contains a small amount of material pertaining to Stone's teaching career. The
		  bulk of this series comes from his time at UNC-Chapel Hill, and includes
		  syllabi, exams, assignments, student papers, and other teaching paperwork. Most
		  heavily represented in this regard is Stone's popular class on censorship, for
		  which there are multiple syllabi and exams from different years and
		  semesters.</p>
         <p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series
		  (RESTRICTED)</emph> collects photographs touching on all aspects of Stone's
		  life, from press photos of Stone and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. to family
		  portraits. Also included in this series are a videotape of a documentary about
		  Powell, press passes and identification badges, and an election pin kept by
		  Stone.</p>
         <p>Unprocessed <emph render="bold">Addition 2009-0009</emph> (50 items; .2 lin. ft.; dated 1963-2005) comprises primarily photographs, but also contains a few letters, clippings, awards, and a dvd-r. The original DVD-R is closed to patron use; however, the information on the disk has been migrated to the electronic records server.</p>
         <p>Addition 2012-0099 has been processed and included in the original collection's description as boxes 64-66. Some parts of this addition have been interfiled into existing boxes.</p>

		  collected by Stone's wife Louise Davis Stone pertaining to the Davis family and
		  their activities. This collection, cataloged separately from the Chuck Stone
		  Papers, is searchable by title in the Duke University Libraries online catalog.

               <p>Series is comprised of clippings kept by Stone. The bulk of these
				are Stone's columns in the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title> (1972-1991)
			 and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">NEA Viewpoint</title> (1987-1995), which deal
			 with topics such as racial politics in the U.S., Philadelphia politics, the
			 media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa, women's issues and feminism, the
			 criminal justice system, and standardized testing, among others. Also included
			 are materials documenting Stone's early journalism career from the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Age</title>,
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Citizen-Call</title>,
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Chicago Daily Defender</title>, and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Washington Afro-American</title>; clippings
			 from various sources documenting Stone's interests and research; and articles
			 about Stone from various publications. Of interest may also be the selection of
			 clippings from 1972-1974 from the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title> that Stone
			 made, apparently for a planned sequel to
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tell it Like it Is</title>, his 1967 book of
			 selected columns from the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Washington Afro-American</title>. These can be
			 found at the end of the clippings from the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Daily News</title>, under the subheading "
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Tellin' it Like it Oughta Be</title>

               <p>Contains Stone's correspondence from the 1960s to 2005. In keeping
				with Stone's original arrangement, some folders are categorized by topic, while
				others simply house general correspondence within a particular span of
				years.</p>
               <p>Of particular interest in the topical folders is the
				correspondence relating to black political power in America (the topic, not
				only Stone's book of the same title) and the correspondence with
				<persname>Edward M. Ryder</persname>, an inmate at the State
				Correctional Facility at Graterford, PA from 1973-1993. Also to be found are
				two folders of correspondence from a number of individuals related to Stone's
				role as negotiator in the hostage crisis at Graterford in 1981.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the remainder of the series is made up of two
				categories. One is simply general correspondence. These folders contain
				correspondence from such figures as
				<persname>Martin Luther King, Jr.</persname>,
				<persname>Jackie Robinson</persname>,
				<persname>Nelson A. Rockefeller</persname>,
				<persname>Barry Goldwater</persname>,
				<persname>LeRoi Jones</persname>,
				<persname>Edward Kennedy</persname>, and others, along with family
				correspondence and business correspondence both to and from Stone from the
				1960s to the 2000s. The other is correspondence specific to Stone's position as
				editor and columnist at the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title>, which
			 includes internal memos and letters with other staff members, letters from
			 readers, and business letters relevant to his position at the newspaper.
			 Researchers should be aware that these appear to be rough categorizations on
			 Stone's part, and that there are a few letters specific to his role at the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title> in the general
			 correspondence folders, and some general business correspondence in the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philadelphia Daily News</title> folders.</p>
               <p>It should also be noted that correspondence on particular topics
				can also be found in relevant series. For instance, correspondence with or
				relating to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. is to be found in that series. Researchers
				interested in Stone's role with the Graterford crisis and his correspondence
				with prison inmates should also consult the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Criminal justice system</title> files in
			 the Subject Files Series.</p>

               <p>Series houses the contents of four scrapbooks kept by Stone,
				disbound for preservation purposes and housed in archival folders. The
				materials document Stone's media appearances, journalism career, and public
				relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. from the 1950s to the end of the
				1960s. Each scrapbook deals with a different period of Stone's life, as
				designated by the bulk dates for each scrapbook, and has been supplied by the
				archivist with an appropriate name. The first houses clippings, mostly from the

			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Age</title>, documenting Stone's time
			 with that newspaper. The second includes clippings, programs, and
			 correspondence collected while Stone was correspondent for and editor of the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Washington Afro-American</title>. It also
			 contains several columns by Stone in the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Citizen-Call</title>, letters by
			 Stone that appeared in the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">New York Times</title> and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">The Washington, D.C. Evening Star</title>, and
			 a number of clippings about Stone from various Washington and national
			 newspapers. The third scrapbook houses clippings, programs, leaflets, and a
			 small amount of correspondence documenting Stone's time in Chicago, where he
			 was columnist for and editor of the
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Chicago Defender</title> and, later,
			 television commentator for
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">WCIU Chicago</title>. The Powell scrapbook
			 documents Stone's activities as press secretary and special assistant to Adam
			 Clayton Powell, Jr. and contains clippings, correspondence, programs, leaflets,
			 and flyers, as well as a folder of miscellaneous articles and media appearances
			 by Stone spanning from the 1960s to 1990.</p>

               <p>Houses Stone's extensive files in many different subject areas,
				consisting primarily of clippings, but also containing notes on the topics and
				some minimal correspondence. The folders have been preserved as closely to
				their original order as possible, and Stone's titles have been retained. The
				exception to this is a set of subheadings that were added to four groups of
				folders that were physically and topically associated by Stone, and which are
				of particular interest. These are his files on censorship and the first
				amendment, on which he intended to write a book (
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Free Speech and Jealous Mistresses</title>,
			 unpublished) and taught regularly throughout the 1990s; on the criminal justice
			 system, focused around issues of racism within that system and on Stone's
			 activities as a mediator between the police and inmates or suspected criminals;
			 on the politics and racial bias of standardized testing, an issue with which he
			 became involved while working with the
			 <corpname>Education and Labor Committee</corpname> under Adam Clayton
			 Powell, Jr.; and files relating to his academic career, activities, and
			 institutional politics at the University of North Carolina. These can be found
			 under the subheadings
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Censorship,</title>
                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Criminal justice system,</title>
                  <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">Standardized testing,</title> and
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote" xlink:href="">UNC</title> respectively. The files on
			 censorship are especially numerous (filling six archival boxes) and contain
			 extensive information on censorship law, types of censorship, and individual
			 instances of censorship. Other topics in this series include black political
			 power in the U.S., minority journalists, women's issues and feminism,
			 affirmative action, religion, electoral politics in the U.S., journalism,
			 multiculturalism and political correctness, higher education, gay and lesbian
			 issues, Philadelphia politics and politicians, and racial politics more
			 generally. There are also significant files on such figures as Mumia Abu Jamal,
			 Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., Camille Paglia, Colin Powell, and
			 Clarence Thomas. Subject files relating specifically to Stone's duties as
			 special assistant to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. can be found in the Adam Clayton
			 Powell, Jr. Congressional Series.</p>
