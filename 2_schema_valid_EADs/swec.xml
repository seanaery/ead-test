         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Southeast Women's Employment Coalition Records (SWEC) span the period 1868 to 1991 with
        the bulk dating from 1981 to 1990. The multiracial, regional organization was founded
        chiefly to expand employment opportunities for women in the rural South. Correspondence,
        financial records, reports, printed material, personnel files, photographs, audiovisual
        material, writings, meeting minutes, and conference papers comprise the majority of the
        collection. Well documented are the Southeast Women's Employment Coalition's efforts: to
        provide leadership training for women; to encourage women to apply for nontraditional jobs,
        for example through its Women's Opportunity in Road Construction (WORC) Project; to promote
        women's employment in the tourism industry; to evaluate economic, social and political
        trends affecting women in the South such as child care, comparable worth, and nontraditional
        jobs for women; and to establish ties with other organizations seeking to improve women's
        economic status. Administrative concerns relating to the Southeast Women's Employment
        Coalition, including personnel, financial, and organizational issues are also well
        described. Represented extensively are their efforts to raise money from private foundations
        and businesses. Organizations highlighted in the collection include Public Affairs Research
        and Communications, Inc. and the Women's Technical Assistance Project. In general,
        information concerning these topics and organizations is scattered throughout the
        collection.</p>
         <p>Leadership training for women, for example through workshops and conferences, is documented
        by the Research Director's Files Series, Writings Series, Project Files Series, Conference
        Files Series, Printed Material Series, Office Files Series, and Audiovisual Series. In
        addition, there is information on efforts to encourage women's employment in highway
        construction and tourism through congressional hearings and writings in the Research
        Director's Files Series, General Files Series, Project Files Series, Highways Projects Files
        Series, Pictures Series, and Audiovisual Series.</p>
         <p>Papers evaluating the economic, social, and political trends affecting women in the South
        such as child care issues and salaries are found in the Research Director's Files Series,
        Office Files Series, Writings Series, General Files Series, Project Files Series, Highways
        Projects Files Series, Subject Files Series, Conference Files Series, Organizations Series,
        Printed Material Series, and Audiovisual Series. Attempts to establish ties with other
        organizations are found in the Research Director's Files Series, Office Files Series,
        Financial Papers Series, General Files Series, Proposals Series, Highways Projects Files
        Series, Conference Files Series, Organizations Series, and Audiovisual Series. The
        organizations include the Restaurant Employees Association of Lexington, Ky., Tradeswomen,
        Inc., and Women for Economic Justice.</p>
         <p>Administrative concerns relating to the Southeast Women's Employment Coalition are
        addressed by the Research Director's Files Series, Board and Staff Meetings Series, Office
        Files Series, Correspondence Series, Financial Papers Series, Personnel Files Series,
        General Files Series, Proposals Series, Project Files Series, and Audiovisual Series.
        Information pertaining to Public Affairs Research and Communications, Inc. and the Women's
        Technical Assistance Project are included in the Proposals Series, Office Files Series,
        General Files Series, Organizations Series, and the Project Files Series.</p>
