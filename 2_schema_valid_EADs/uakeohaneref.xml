         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Nannerl O. Keohane served as Duke University's
		  eighth president, from 1993 to 2004. She was born in
		  Blytheville, Ark., and grew up in Arkansas, Texas, and
		  South Carolina. Her parents, who were great music lovers,
		  named her after Mozart's musically talented sister,
		  Nannerl. Her father, James Overholser, a Presbyterian
		  minister, went on to earn a doctorate in theology and
		  taught religion and theology at St. Andrews Presbyterian
		  College in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Her mother, Grace
		  Overholser White, worked as a reporter before marriage and
		  then, later in life, taught English and served as dean at
		  St. Andrews. </p>
         <p>Nan Keohane was valedictorian of her Hot Springs
		  (Ark.) High School. She is a 1961 graduate of Wellesley
		  College, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa with honors in
		  political science. Following graduation from Wellesley, she
		  was awarded a Marshall Scholarship to Oxford University,
		  where she earned the B.A.-M.A. with First Class Honors in
		  philosophy, politics, and economics. She received her Ph.D.
		  in political science in 1967 from Yale, where she was a
		  Sterling Fellow and, later, was awarded the Wilbur Cross
		  Medal in recognition of her distinguished service as an
		  alumna. </p>
         <p>Before assuming the presidency of Wellesley in
		  1981, she taught at Swarthmore College, the University of
		  Pennsylvania, and Stanford University, where she was chair
		  of the faculty senate and won the Gores Award for
		  Excellence in Teaching. </p>
         <p>Keohane has written extensively in the fields of
		  political philosophy, feminism and education. She is the
		  author of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Philosophy and the State in
		  France: The Renaissance to the Enlightenment</title>
		(Princeton University Press, 1980) and co-editor of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Feminist Theory: A Critique of
		  Ideology</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1982). She
		was vice president of the American Political Science
		Association from 1988 to 1990. </p>
         <p>Keohane has served on the boards of IBM, the
		  National Humanities Center, the Doris Duke Charitable
		  Foundation and the Research Triangle Foundation of North
		  Carolina. She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts
		  and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, a
		  member of the Council on Foreign Relations and chairs the
		  Overseers Committee to Visit the John F. Kennedy School of
		  Government at Harvard. </p>
         <p>She has been awarded honorary doctoral degrees by
		  numerous colleges and universities. She was inducted into
		  the National Women's Hall of Fame in October 1995, and won
		  the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of
		  Achievement in 1998.</p>
