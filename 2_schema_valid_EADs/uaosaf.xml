         <p>Because the Office of Student Activities and Facilities Records contain a sampling of documents from many Duke University student groups that span several decades, the collection complements many others already held in the University Archives. The following is a short but not exhaustive list of related collections that can be accessed at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Additional materials can be found by searching the online catalog for the names of individual groups, university offices, residential houses, and fraternities and sororities.</p>

                  <p>Although apparently compiled in 1937, the lists in this folder group cite officers of various clubs and organizations as early as the late 1880s. In addition to documenting the histories of various campus groups, the folders contain extensive demographic data about the student body spanning several decades, since student officers' home addresses are given in most cases. The folder "Class Officers" contains "A Tentative List of Student Organizations and Enterprises, Trinity College and Duke University, 1846-1937," a compilation of some 400 student organizations from the first century of the university's history.</p>

               <p>Records include materials related to Duke Student Government, the Duke University Union,  ongoing campus series such as Major Attractions and Major Speakers, the Office of University Life, and extensive event registration forms and contracts related to the Events Advising Committee (EAC).</p>
               <p>Arrangement:  Materials were received predominantly unarranged, with some folders batched by campus group, some chronologically, and some in no discernible order. Arrangement is now chronological by fiscal year. Fiscal years 1959-1994, which contain only a small amount of material, are arranged in one group by folder title. Following that, FY 1994-95 through FY 2005-06 are arranged year-by-year, and will be made available to researchers as each successive 25-year restriction is lifted.</p>
