         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p> Basil Lee Whitener Papers primarily contain the office files of Congressman Whitener when he was the U. S. Representative for the Eleventh District (85th - 87th Congresses) and Tenth District (88th -90th Congresses) of North Carolina. Although the papers span the years 1889-1968, the bulk of the papers covers Whitener's years in office, 1957-1968. Some of the early files from the 81st through the 84th Congresses, are the papers of Woodrow Wilson Jones, Whitener's predecessor in office.</p>
         <p>luded in the papers are such Items as correspondence, printed material, invitations, speeches, clippings, financial papers, photographs, as well as legislative materials and drafts of bills. Much of this collection consists of correspondence between Whitener and his constituents, other Congressmen, and government officials.</p>
         <p>The papers are divided into the following series:</p>
         <p>
            <list type="simple">
               <item>Political</item>
               <item>Correspondence (General) </item>

               <item>Personal</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>By far the largest category is the Correspondence (General), even though it was weeded extensively. The Correspondence (Legislative) Series is also rather large. Both of these series contain extensive correspondence with constituents. Other large series are the Personal Series, which pertains more directly to Whitener's private and unofficial affairs, and the Office Files Series, containing files which seem to have been in active use by Whitener's office staff at the time he left office.</p>
         <p>There are information and opinions in the collection on a variety of issues of national importance during the 1960s. Included are the Vietnam War, civil rights legislation, riots, crime legislation, gun control, foreign aid, Social Security, and the Taft-Hartley Act. Other subjects are the U. S. Congress and various bills and laws. There are a variety of letters from prominent persons, such as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Sargent Shriver, Strom Thurmond, and Sam Ervin.</p>
         <p>The views of Whitener on many national and state issues are revealed within the collection. He supported legislation to combat crime and civil disobedience, a strong national defense, and exerting every effort to bring the Vietnamese Conflict to a successful conclusion. The Congressman was opposed to civil rights legislation, deficit spending, foreign aid spending, and the proliferation of domestic and social programs. Concerning North Carolina issues, Whitener wanted restrictions on textile imports in order to protect jobs, and supported the concept of a balanced economy in the state. As a member of the Committee on the District of Columbia, he authored bills to curb the crime rate in the District of Columbia and a bill to establish a modern rail rapid transit system in the District. In general, Whitener seemed to exhibit the views of conservative Southern Democrats.</p>
         <p>Specific subjects are noted in more detail in the inventory. There is some overlap of subjects among the series.</p>

         <head>Note on Processing and Arrangement</head>
         <p>The arrangement of the Whitener Papers has followed the system originally used by the Congressman's office as much as possible. The series were grouped by placing the more significant and larger series in the beginning. The Personal Series was placed at the end. Although the collection was usually left in the structure it had when it came to the library, many of the folders within the series were in various states of disorder. Rearrangement of the order of these folders was often necessary in order to create a logical organization, whether it be chronological, subject, or some other arrangement. Folder titles remain intact whenever possible, except when clarification was necessary.</p>
         <p>Although categories do indicate the contents, headings are not always inclusive. For example, there may be information on a Social Security bill in the Correspondence (Legislative) Series. However, information on the same bill may be located in other series, such as the House of Representatives or Judiciary. Such folders were retained in their original files.</p>
         <p>Weeding out of certain material was a necessary part of the cataloging process for the collection. Two series were discarded. They were: the File Cards Series, containing only names and addresses with no other notations; and the Appalachian State Graduates Series, including names and addresses of graduates in the Tenth Congressional District. Routine Items were eliminated from the collection, especially in the Correspondence (General) Series, Subject Series, Case Files Series, and Personal Series. Examples of such Items are individual Social Security claims, visa applications, routine correspondence, and duplicates In the Military and Veterans Series only the files for the letter "C" were retained, as well as a few small subject folders. The majority of the folders in the Military Academy Series was discarded because they were individual application materials and academic records of Whitener's appointees. The same procedures as above were followed for the routine Military and Veterans, and Military Academy files contained in the Office Files Series. For more specific information, see the individual descriptions of series in the inventory.</p>
         <p>Subject and autograph cards have been prepared for the card catalog, but they are very selective. Subject entries were made for series level topics, and for those of folder headings, if of sufficient importance. Whenever a subject entry was made, other references in other categories are possible because it was not feasible to specifically cite all references to a topic. Autograph cards were made only for outstanding correspondents, especially those in the Correspondence (General) Series.</p>

                  <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> Included is correspondence to and from <persname>Whitener</persname>'s constituents. Some of the letters were written by his administrative assistant, <persname>Herbert M. Lineberger. </persname>The papers are organized by Congress and session, and then alphabetically within each session by name of correspondent. In some cases Whitener's office held material together about a certain person in the folder for the letter of the alphabet for his name, regardless of the correspondents involved. For example, there may be letters about <persname>Mr. Capps </persname>in the <emph render="doublequote">C</emph> folder, which were written by various persons. There are a few subject folders included in the alphabetical arrangement. Items within the folders are filed chronologically.</p>

                  <persname>Whitener </persname>was a member of the Judiciary Committee from <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1959</date> to <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> See the page earlier in this inventory which describes his committee assignments for further information concerning his specific subcommittee assignments. The Judiciary Series and Judiciary Committee Series have been kept separate because they were organized this way in Whitener's office. The Judiciary Committee Series contains folders for the work of this committee and certain sub-committees. The Judiciary Series is larger and more general in nature. The two major files in this series are Legislative Bills, the largest section, and Subject Files for Legislation, etc.</p>

                  <p>In this section, which forms a major part of the Judiciary Series, are numerous folders for various <corpname>House of Representatives </corpname>bills, as well as for a few <subject>House Joint Resolutions, </subject>
                     <subject>House Concurrent Resolutions, </subject>and <subject>Senate Bills. </subject>Whitener introduced about two-thirds of the bills represented in this section. The folders usually contain a copy of the bill, and often printed reports, correspondence, and other background information. There was no apparent order to the bills. Therefore, they were arranged by Congress and session, and by specific bill (H.R.) number, and run from the 85th Congress, 1st Session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1957</date> to the 89th Congress, 2nd session, <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1966.</date> A comprehensive listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is filed in folder one of the first box of the Legislative Bills files. Some subject entries have been made for important content, such as civil rights, but not for most bill names.</p>

               <p>In this series are papers which primarily concern Whitener's duties as a member of the <corpname>House Committee on the Judiciary. </corpname>He was a member of this committee from <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1959</date> to <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"> 1968.</date> See the page in this inventory which describes his committee assignments for further information concerning his specific subcommittee assignments. Some files relating specifically to the work of the Judiciary Committee, and the subcommittee on which he served, are contained in this series. The Judiciary Committee Series and Judiciary Series have been kept separate because they were organized this way in Whitener's office. The Judiciary Series is larger and more general in nature than this series. The two major files in this series are Legislative Bills and Subject Files for Legislation, Etc.</p>

               <p>Although this series is very similar to the Subject Series in that it contains folders on miscellaneous topics, the two series were evidently separate in Whitener's office. There was no consistent order to the folders, so they have been arranged alphabetically, similarly to the Subject Series. Some folder title revisions were necessary. A particularly large section of this series is the three boxes of material from the <corpname>National Federation of Independent Business </corpname>containing ballots by businessmen on various issues. Some routine Items such as individual <corpname>Veterans Administration </corpname>and social security claims, as well as passport applications were discarded.</p>

The Military and Veterans Files primarily consist of correspondence between <persname>Jones </persname>or <persname>Whitener </persname>and their constituents. Generally, all correspondence for persons whose last name begins with the same letter of the alphabet has been kept together under that letter. Occasional folders appear for single individuals. These files originally formed a large part of the office files of <persname>Jones </persname>and <persname>Whitener. </persname>The military records, for persons still on active duty or in the reserves, pertain to such matters as requests for transfers, reassignments, allotments, hardship discharges, deferments, and dependents to go overseas. Constituents also wrote concerning <subject>courts-martial, </subject>
                  <subject>Officer Candidate School applications, </subject>
                  <subject>AWOL soldiers, </subject>and efforts to locate a soldier. The veterans records include letters concerning <subject>dependency allowances, </subject>
                  <subject>widow pension benefits, </subject>
                  <subject>hospitalization benefits, </subject>
                  <subject>insurance, </subject>
                  <subject>disability claims, </subject>and appeals to the <corpname>Board of Veterans Appeals. </corpname>Since these papers are very routine, concerning individual benefits and requests, rather than being topical in nature, only a representative sample has been retained. The letter <emph render="doublequote">C,</emph> a large letter which includes a wide range of ethnic groups, was chosen for retention, as well as a few small subject folders.</p>

                  <p>In the Legislative Bills section there are folders for various <corpname>House of Representatives </corpname>Bills, as well as for a <corpname>Senate </corpname>bill. <persname>Whitener </persname>introduced about one half of the <corpname>House </corpname>bills represented here. Folders usually contain a copy of the bill, and sometimes printed reports, correspondence, and other background information. Arrangement of the folders is by Congress and session, and by specific bill (H.R.) number. A comprehensive listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is filed in folder one of the first box of the Legislative Bills files.</p>

               <p>Included are papers relating more directly to Whitener's private and unofficial affairs. The matters contained here range from such things as Whitener's admission to the <corpname>District of Columbia Bar </corpname>and his weekly radio program, to Whitener's apartment rental, bills and receipts, and family reunions.</p>
               <p>These files were in disarray, and therefore have been organized into three major categories: Congresses, Subject Files, and General Files. In the first subdivision, Congresses, the papers are grouped by Congress, session, and then alphabetically within each session of Congress. This information was evidently kept together in this manner by Whitener's office. There is repetition in some categories in various Congresses, such as Correspondence (Alphabetical). The explanatory notes for such categories have been included in the inventory only with the earliest Congress in which the category appears. The category, Congresses, forms the bulk of the Personal Series.</p>
               <p>In the Subject Files are topics such as the National Federation of Independent Business, which span several years. The General Files contain biographical information, financial papers, miscellany, clippings, printed material, and pictures.</p>
               <p>The following types of items were discarded from the Personal Series:</p>
               <p>
                  <list type="simple">
                     <item>1. Routine bills, receipts, and statements pertaining to the ordering of office supplies from the U.S. House of Representatives Stationery Room.</item>
                     <item>2. Many bills, receipts, and other personal financial papers.</item>
                     <item>3. Routine items from the voluminous "General" files. The remaining items were filed among various appropriate categories, such as correspondence, printed material, and finanical papers.</item>
