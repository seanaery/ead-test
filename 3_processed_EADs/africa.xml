         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>Africa News Service (ANS) is a non-profit U. S. news agency founded in
               <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1973.</date> It is a leading information source on Africa in the United States
            and works in partnership with African news agencies and periodicals to make available
            current and background materials on all aspects of African life, politics, and culture.
            Through its efforts, coverage of Africa has been more frequent, more substantive, and
            more accurate, filling a vital gap for policy makers, educators, journalists, diplomats,
            scientists, religious groups, development analysts, and business and labor leaders.
            Widely known for its periodical <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Africa News</title>, the award
            winning ANS also prepares special articles and series for major newspapers and broadcast
            programs and provides behind-the-scenes consultation and briefing for news agencies and
            individual journalists. Keeping pace with innovative computer technologies, ANS shifted
            in 1993 from printed to electronic publication by establishing <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Africa News Online</title>. Through this on-line service ANS engages in computerized
            news gathering and distribution and e-mail communications with reporters in Africa. This
            on-line service is distributed commercially by international vendors such as Lexis/Nexis
            and Financial Times Information and is on the World Wide Web at www.africanews.org.</p>
         
         <p>ANS is located in Durham, N. C. and is led by a trio of Duke graduates: Executive
            Director Bertie Howard ('69), Executive Editor Tamela Hultman ('68), and President and
            Managing Editor Reed Kramer ('69). In <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1996</date> ANS and Duke University embarked
            on two collaborative ventures, the Center for Africa and the Media (CAM) as well as the
            the LeRoy T. Walker Africa News Service Archive. CAM is a joint program with Duke
            University's African and African American Studies Program that will help develop
            curricular offerings and conduct scholarly research as well as initiate visits and
            international exchanges with journalists and media scholars.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The LeRoy T. Walker Africa News Service Archive is an extensive resource file assembled
            by ANS over the course of two decades in support of its news gathering efforts about
            Africa-related issues and U. S. foreign policy towards Africa. The collection spans the
            years from approximately <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1960 to 1995,</unitdate> with the
            bulk of the materials dating from <unitdate type="bulk" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1978 through 1994.</unitdate>
            Newspaper clippings, magazine articles, press releases, newsletters, brochures, and
            reports comprise the collection. Much of the material is gathered from mainstream media
            sources and government documentation in the United States, Europe, Africa, and other
            parts of the world. In addition, the collection includes significant resources from
            alternative, minority, and special interest presses world-wide that may be difficult to
            locate elsewhere. The archive contains scarce and difficult-to-locate materials such as
            numerous publications produced by non-governmental organizations and
            grass-roots/community groups that are/were involved in efforts related to independence
            movements, economic development, and human rights issues in Africa.</p>
         
         <p>The archive is arranged in several series that provide a perspective on African politics
            and development from almost every country in the world. The heart of the archives is
            comprised of files about each African country. There are also significant files on U.S.
            politics and foreign policy and the United Nations. As ANS is located in North Carolina,
            there was a specific effort to document the activities and interests of North
            Carolinians as related to African issues. The archive encompasses a wide range of topics
            including agriculture, children, economics, education, health, history, politics, peace
            negotiations, social conditions, war, wildlife, and women. There are files on
            individuals, media organizations, political and cultural groups, corporations, and
            lobbyists. The collection documents the movement for African independence and economic
            development in the latter half of the twentieth century.</p>
         
         <p>The archive is named in honor of LeRoy T. Walker, long-time supporter and honorary chair
            of the ANS Board of Directors. Mr. Walker is president-emeritus of the U. S. Olympic
            Committee and chancellor-emeritus of North Carolina Central University. A past president
            of The Athletic Congress, he has had a multi-faceted career in sports, physical
            education and educational administration; he has received numerous honors and honorary
            degrees. He has coached U. S. Olympic teams and trained and coached many African and
            American athletes. In the <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1960s</date> he served as director of programming and
            training for Africa at the Peace Corps in Washington, D.C.</p>
         
         <p>Also transferred with the archive is a large number of Africa-related books,
            periodicals, and other printed materials. These items are being integrated and cataloged
            as part of Perkins Library's holdings on Africa and are identified in the on-line
            catalog by the (corporate) author entry: Africa News Service (Durham, N.C.)
            Archives.</p>
         
         <p> The addition (9450 items, dated 1952-1993 and undated, bulk 1952-ca. 1980, 18.20 linear
            feet) contains resource files, newspaper clippings and other media, and periodicals,
            books, and pamphlets on various topics pertaining to South Africa and Southern Africa
            (especially Rhodesia and Zimbabwe). Topics include labor, industry, the economy, and
            foreign trade with South Africa; social conditions in South Africa including the state
            of Indian South Africans; and student, Christian, and other political movements against
            apartheid, including the National Union of South African Students and the University
            Christian Movement. Also includes 3 black-and-white photographs, and 3 microfiche.
            Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Collection of African and African-American
            Documentation. (01-156) </p>

            <head>Notes On Arrangement And Folder Titles</head>
            
            <p>The collection is retained as it was assembled by ANS. The files were collected over
               two decades by a variety of staff members and volunteers. As issues in Africa
               evolved, subject files were established, emphasized or de-emphasized, resulting in
               some overlap in focus and sometimes inconsistency in filing. Many of the folder
               titles include span dates; however, it is not unusual to find materials dated earlier
               or later. As noted previously, the collection spans the period of the <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1960s through 1995.</unitdate> Some dates on the folder titles
               are noted with the prefix, "thru" or a dash, e.g., <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">"-1977"</date>. This
               indicates that the materials in the files dated before and up to <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1977.</date>
               If there is a dash after the date, e.g., " <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1983-</date>", this indicates the
               files date <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1983</date> forward. The span dates on the container list sometimes
               differ from the dates on the folder title. In preparing the container list, student
               workers sometimes looked within the folder to determine the actual span dates and
               listed this information. Attempts were made by ANS staff to arrange materials
               chronologically within the folders. Over time with numerous people using and filing
               the materials, some of this arrangement within the folder may have been lost.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes within the folders there are white slips of paper with a bibliographic
               citation. This is an indication that there is a relevant article in a periodical. The
               periodical title is often noted by an acronym. A key to the list of acronyms can be
               found after the List of Series below. Most of the periodicals cited should be
               available in Duke University's Perkins Library in hard copy, microform, or
               electronically.</p>
            
            <p>Occasionally there are files labelled with just the letter of the alphabet, preceding
               folders with information about a specific topic. Such files were established when
               there were only one or two articles about the subject and a separate folder was not
               yet warranted. For example in the series, "Persons," there is a file for each letter
               of the alphabet, preceding the files labelled by individuals' names. This indicates
               that the file contains materials on several people whose last name begins with that
               letter of the alphabet. There are a few terms used as folder titles that require some
               clarification.</p>
            
            <p>"General" indicates there was not sufficient material on a subject to divide into
               categories. Therefore the file would include a range of topics. For example, "South
               Africa: Bantustans - General" would include a variety of information about Bantustans
               as a subject and specific Bantustans. Following "General" are files on specific
               Bantustans, e.g., "Ciskei," indicating that there was sufficient information about
               Ciskei to warrant its own folder.</p>
            
            <p>Bibliography is not used in the traditional sense of a list of citations, but rather
               is a file that includes book announcements, book reviews, or other statements about a
               publication of interest. Such materials can also be found interfiled within a
               specific subject file.</p>
            
            <p>Reference files included brochures, pamphlets, statistics, and maps providing
               background information about a subject, usually a country.</p>
            
            <p>Diplomacy files are used only in the series, "Africa: Countries," and refers to
               pre-independence efforts to form a new country. These files would include information
               on negotiations with former colonial powers, the United Nations, and/or with
               neighboring African countries. After independence was achieved files were labelled
               under the title, "politics."</p>
            
            <p>Foreign Relations and Foreign Policy were not always clearly distinguished during the
               filing process. However, foreign policy focuses more on establishing positions
               related to issues while foreign relations deal with the interaction between countries
               based on the foreign policy.</p>

               <p>These files are organized for the geographical regions of Africa, e.g., Central
                  Africa. The information focuses on areas of common concern or shared interests
                  such as weather, agriculture, ethnic groups, or resources. For example: many of
                  the files under Southern Africa deal with the peace process in Angola (Box 22 -
                  23), inasmuch as several countries were involved in this effort. It is useful to
                  also check for related materials in the files under the appropriate individual
                  country in the series, "Africa: Countries." </p>

                  subjects cover a broad range of topics from health, history, military, refugees
                  and students, to specific events, conferences, and organizations. There are
                  related materials in other series such as "Persons," which includes files on noted
                  personalities involved in Africa-related concerns, and "U.S. Foreign Relations,"
                  which provides insight into the United States policy toward specific African
                  countries.</p>

               <p>This series focuses on U.S. foreign policy concerns in broad topics such as the
                  CIA, human rights, immigration, Peace Corps., terrorism, and United Nations. These
                  topics may include Africa-related issues; however, most of the files related to U.
                  S. foreign policy toward Africa are located in series, "U.S. Foreign Relations:
                  Africa" and "U. S. Foreign Relations: African Countries."</p>

               <p>In this series the beginning files focus on Africa as a continent; thereafter
                  files are arranged alphabetically intermixing individual African countries and
                  African regions. In distinguishing foreign policy from foreign relations --
                  foreign policy focuses more on establishing positions related to issues while
                  foreign relations deal with the interaction between the countries based on the
                  foreign policy. Within the files there is information about ambassadorial
                  appointments, meetings with high officials, and cultural, educational, and
                  scientific exchanges. Related materials are in the series, "U. S. Politics."</p>

               <p>These are U. S. groups that have some connection with Africa, such as Americans
                  Concerned About South Africa, Gulf Boycott Coalition, and the Washington Office on
                  Africa. These groups formed around political, humanitarian, educational or
                  cultural concerns and range from small local entities to large national groups and
                  branches of international organizations. Some of these organizations no longer

                  respond to a specific event or issue that has passed. There are related files in

               <p>These groups do not have Africa-related concerns as their primary focus, although
                  their efforts may include African issues. The groups represent a wide range of
                  entities including foundations; political, religious, and humanitarian
                  organizations; universities; unions; community groups; and branches of
                  international organizations. Among the groups are the Ford Foundation, All
                  People's Congress, National Council of Churches, Bread for the World, Peoples
                  College, United Mine Workers, and Coalition for a New Foreign and Military Policy.

               <p>ANS has a strong interest in how Africa is covered by the U. S. media. This series
                  includes information on mainstream, alternative, minority and special interest
                  publications as well as radio and television. The files provide information about
                  the type and amount (usually lack of) coverage given to African issues by U.S.
                  media. There are also compilations of editorials that reveal an individual media
                  organization's viewpoint on Africa. Over time, such editorials were filed under
                  the appropriate subject rather than by the media organization. Related materials
                  about individual journalists and publishers are located in the series,

               <p>This series provides background information about branches of government,
                  political parties, ethnic groups (especially African-Americans), social issues and
                  events that impact on U. S. politics. This series does not focus on Africa but
                  does give the positions of groups and elected officials relative to general
                  questions of foreign policy. Among the topics are the Congressional Black Caucus,
                  presidential appointments, the Freedom of Information Act, The New Alliance Party,
                  and the Ku Klux Klan. Policies of Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton can
                  be found here as well as in the series "Persons." Related materials may also be
                  found in the series "U.S. Foreign Policy."</p>

               <p>Represented here are businesses, universities, media, political and community
                  groups in North Carolina and broad topics about the State's economy, environment,
                  education, and politics. Most of the files reflect activities and concerns related
                  to African issues, but sometimes the file simply provides background information.
                  Among the groups are Carolina Population Center, Committee for a Democratic
                  Future, Mechanics and Farmers Bank, Davidson College, and the Carolinian. There
                  are related files in the series "U.S. Groups," "U. S. Africa Groups," and
                  "World."</p>

               <p>This series begins with a focus on broad issues that impact countries throughout
                  the world (Box 286-310). Topics include children, commodities, finance, food,
                  housing, migration, nuclear energy, population, tourism, trade, water, and
                  workers. The files on commodities (e.g., cashews, gold, oil, sugar, tobacco, and
                  uranium) include a generous amount of U. S. government reports. There are also
                  files on international organizations (Box 305 - 306) that were involved with
                  Africa. Files on the United Nations (Box 311-316) comprised a significant portion
                  of this series. These files document the involvement of the UN in the formation
                  and the economic and political development of African countries. Topics covered
                  include aid, decolonization, education, health, and peacekeeping. There are files
                  about various branches of the UN such as UNICEF, UNESCO, FAO, and WHO; and
                  UN-sponsored conferences such as the Summit for the Environment, Decade for Women
                  and International Literacy Year. This series concludes with files documenting
                  Africa's relations with other parts of the world (Box 316-332). Topics include
                  humanitarian aid, economic development, trade, cultural exchange and tourism.
                  These files are organized by region or continent such as Latin America and Asia.
                  Within each region are files for individual countries.</p>

               <p>Files in this series are about individuals including politicians, journalists,
                  artists, business people, and military and movement leaders. Many have a specific
                  African connection although some may not. A few of the names found here are
                  Muhummad Ali, Steve Biko, Shirley Temple Black, Miriam Makeba, Ronald Reagan, and
                  Walter Sisulu. Preceding the alphabetical listing of individuals' names is a
                  folder for each letter of the alphabet that contains materials on several people.
                  This file was maintained when there was only one or two articles about a person
                  and did not yet warrant starting a separate folder.</p>

               <p>These are files on national and international businesses. Most have African
                  connections but not all. The companies may have been trading partners or investors
                  or have had a role in political or military events in Africa such as divestment in
                  South Africa, armaments, or weapons dealing. Among the corporations included are
                  Air Afrique, De Beers Group, General Motors, Nabisco, and Sony Corporation.
                  Preceding the alphabetical listing of corporate names is a folder for each letter
                  of the alphabet that contains materials on several corporations. This file was
                  maintained when there was only one or two articles about a person and did not yet
                  warrant starting a separate folder. </p>
