         <abstract>Documentary photographer and writer based in western North Carolina. The photographs and papers of Rob Amberg span the years 1975-2009. Photographs are contained in the first three series in the collection and are arranged by project name: The New Road: I-26 and the Footprints of Progress; The Sodom Laurel Album; and The Vanishing Culture of Agriculture. Photographs are 8x10 and 11x14 inch gelatin silver prints and pigmented inkjet color prints. Amberg's papers account for the rest of the collection and are organized into 4 series: Correspondence, Printed Material, Subject Files, and Writings and Research. Amberg's focus is primarily the social customs of the rural South, especially in his home state of North Carolina. He has a special concern for documenting the way in which industrial and economic progress seems to be erasing many aspects of rural culture at the turn of the twenty-first century.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Rob Amberg Photographs and Papers span the years 1975-2009.</p>
         
         <p>The photographs consist of 8x10 and 11x14 inch gelatin silver prints and pigmented inkjet color prints. Amberg's focus as a photographer is primarily the social customs of the rural South, especially in his home state of North Carolina. He has a special concern for documenting the way in which industrial and economic progress seems to be erasing many aspects of rural culture at the turn of the twenty-first century. The collection is arranged into three project series: <ref xlink:type="simple" target="newroad" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">
               
               <emph render="bold">The New Road: I-26 and the Footprints of Progress</emph>

               <emph render="bold">The Vanishing Culture of Agriculture</emph>
            
            </ref>. Images range from landscape shots taken before and during construction of an interstate highway in the N.C. mountains, to portraits of individuals and families affected by the changes in rural culture. Images also depict agricultural activies such as tobacco cultivation and dairy cattle farming, as well as work in the poultry industry. Many of Amberg's images in this last series were funded by the Rural Advancement Fund to document the rural Carolinas, and by the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. Captions and numbering are taken from original notes on the back of each print. Series are arranged in alphabetical order by title of project.</p>
         
         <p>Amberg's papers are organized into 4 series. The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="correspondence" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">

         <p>Amberg worked and contributed to a number of non-profit organizations dealing with farm worker's rights and other social issues. Collections of materials relating to these non-profits are housed in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="subjectfiles" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">
               
               <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph>
            
            </ref>. Printed materials in this series include annual reports and publications by each organization. Most of the materials include photography work by Amberg.</p>
         
         <p>Included in Amberg's papers is the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="writings" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">

Many of the images are from North Carolina and were part of an on-going assignment funded by the Rural Advancement Fund to document the rural Carolinas; others formed part of an annual report assigned and supported by the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. Several images document organic farmers and their activities, and one of the last African-American dairy farmers in N.C. Original captions and numbering taken from back of prints. Arranged numerically by negative number.</p>
