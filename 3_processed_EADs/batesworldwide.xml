         <abstract>Bates Worldwide
		  advertising agency (Bates) was established in
		  1940 by former executives of the Benton &amp; Bowles agency. It grew to become
		  one of the largest agencies in the U.S. until its demise in 2003. Bates began
		  as a simple proprietorship, but as the company grew its organizational
		  structure took on different forms: a partnership, then a corporation before
		  becoming a publicly traded transnational entity, and finally becoming a
		  subsidiary in a global holding company. From the 1970s on, Bates' growth and
		  international expansion was fueled by a long series of mergers, partnerships
		  and acquisitions that continued until the company was itself acquired, first by
		  the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and later by the WPP Group. Materials in the
		  collection relate to Bates' permutations into a variety of corporate entities,
		  including Ted Bates &amp; Co., Ted Bates, Inc., Backer Spielvogel Bates, and
		  Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with its subsidiaries (such as Campbell-Mithun and
		  Kobs and Draft) and parent organizations (Cordiant Communications Group,
		  Saatchi &amp; Saatchi). Thus, the collection provides a window into the larger
		  corporate culture of mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and takeovers that
		  led to the formation of giant transnational advertising conglomerates and
		  marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising industry during the
		  late 20th century.  The Bates Worldwide, Inc. Records spans
		  the years 1934-2003 and includes correspondence, corporate policy manuals,
		  photographs, publications, graphic designs, print advertisements, electronic
		  records and videocassettes that document the activities of this major global
		  advertising agency over the course of its corporate life. Bates built its early
		  reputation as an advertising agency with a particular talent for promoting
		  pharmaceutical products (Carter's Pills, Anacin analgesics) and common
		  household goods (Mars candies, Wonder bread, Palmolive soap, Colgate dental
		  cream). Advertising policies developed around a philosophy Bates called the
		  Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which informed an imperative to identify and
		  promote a single, unique and compelling reason for consumers to use any given
		  product or service. As the company grew into a global business, USP evolved
		  into more complex forms, including the Bates Brand Wheel. Major clients
		  included Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., Carter-Wallace Corporation,
		  Hyundai America, the Joint Recruiting Advertising Program of the combined U.S.
		  Armed Services, M&amp;M/Mars Inc., Miller Brewing Company, Pfizer, the U.S.
		  Navy and Wendy's International. There is also some information on the company's
		  founder, Ted Bates, as well as on Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and
		  the chief architect of the USP concept.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Bates Worldwide, Inc. (<emph render="doublequote">Bates</emph>) Records</emph> span the years 1934-2003 and
		  include correspondence, corporate policy manuals, photographs, publications,
		  graphic designs, print advertisements, electronic records and videocassettes
		  that document the activities of this major global advertising agency over the
		  course of its corporate life. Bates began as a simple proprietorship, but as
		  the company grew its organizational structure took on different forms: a
		  partnership, then a corporation before becoming a publicly traded transnational
		  entity, and finally becoming a subsidiary in a global holding company. From the
		  1970s on, Bates' growth and international expansion was fueled by a long series
		  of mergers, partnerships and acquisitions that continued until the company was
		  itself acquired, first by
		  Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and later by the
		  WPP Group. Materials in the collection relate to
		  Bates' permutations into a variety of corporate entities, including
		  Ted Bates &amp; Co.,
		  Ted Bates, Inc.,
		  Backer Spielvogel Bates, and
		  Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with its subsidiaries

		  (such as Campbell-Mithun and Kobs and Draft) and
		  parent organizations
		  (Cordiant Communications Group, Saatchi &amp;
			 Saatchi). Thus, the collection provides a window into the larger
		  corporate culture of mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and takeovers that
		  led to the formation of giant transnational advertising conglomerates and
		  marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising industry during the
		  late 20th century. </p>
         
         <p>Bates built its early reputation as an advertising agency with a
		  particular talent for promoting pharmaceutical products (Carter's Pills, Anacin
		  analgesics) and common household goods (Mars candies, Wonder bread, Palmolive
		  soap, Colgate dental cream). Advertising policies developed around a philosophy
		  Bates called the
		  Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which informed an
		  imperative to identify and promote a single, unique and compelling reason for
		  consumers to use any given product or service. As the company grew into a
		  global business, USP evolved into more complex forms, including the
		  Bates Brand Wheel. Major clients include
		  Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co.,
            Carter-Wallace Corporation,
		  Colgate-Palmolive Company,
		  Hyundai America, the
		  Joint Recruiting Advertising Program of the
		  combined U.S. Armed Services,
		  M&amp;M/Mars Inc.,
		  Miller Brewing Company,
		  Pfizer, the U.S. Navy and
		  Wendy's International. There is also some
		  information on the company's founder,
		  Ted Bates, as well as on
		  Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and the
		  chief architect of the USP concept. </p>
         
         <p>The collection is organized into ten series and one cumulative subject
		  index--Client Files, Corporate Communications Department, Creative Department,
		  Financial Records, Human Resources Department, Memorabilia, New Business, Print
		  Books, Vertical Files and Audiovisual Materials. The <emph render="bold">Client
		  Files Series</emph> includes research reports, storyboards and graphic designs
		  for Bates' clients. The <emph render="bold">Corporate Communications Department
		  Series</emph> includes company-wide memoranda, public relations policy manuals,
		  and a large file of biographical sketches and photographs of Bates' executives,
		  as well as news clippings and press releases relating to the company and its
		  clients. The <emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph> primarily
		  focuses on Bates' efforts to stimulate creativity throughout its worldwide
		  offices through participation in internal and industry-wide advertising
		  competitions. The <emph render="bold">Financial Records Series</emph> includes
		  general ledgers and other accounting reports. The <emph render="bold">Human
		  Resources Department Series</emph> includes employee benefits literature and
		  information on company affairs including press releases and staff memoranda.
		  The <emph render="bold">Memorabilia Series</emph> includes promotional
		  clothing, games, office posters and awards. The <emph render="bold">New
		  Business Series</emph> includes materials relating to requests for proposals
		  from prospective clients. The <emph render="bold">Print Books Series</emph>
		  contains material from over 100 albums of proof sheets and print advertisements
		  from existing clients. The <emph render="bold">Vertical Files Series</emph>
		  consists of an alphabetical file of general information collected to aid in
		  various aspects of company operations. The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual
		  Materials Series</emph> contains periodic review collections of advertising,
		  video memoranda, speeches, retirement presentations and highlight compilations
		  prepared for prospective clients and award show consideration. A
		  <emph render="bold">Subject Cross-Reference Index</emph> at the end of the
		  finding aid links materials pertaining to specific clients, corporations,
		  events and policies scattered throughout the various subject series.</p>
         
         <p>Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were assigned
		  consecutive numbers reflecting the order in which they were encountered. If a
		  work has a corresponding or associated electronic file, the file is included in
		  the container list. The contents of each disk have been migrated to the Special
		  Collections server. Consequently, the contents of these disks are available
		  only in correspondingly numbered electronic subdirectories. Consult a reference
		  archivist for access to the electronic files.</p>

               <p>Corporate reports, correspondence and memoranda, press releases,
				news clippings, general office files and photographs that originated in or were
				maintained by Bates Corporate Communications Department. The series dates
				between 1940-2003 and primarily documents the corporate public relations, news
				events and publicity activities of Bates offices, personnel and clients. The
				materials contained in the series thus record mainly newsworthy events, as
				opposed to daily operations--client relationships and advertising campaigns
				rather than account management specifics, or, promotion announcements rather
				than personnel employment records. Other files reflect materials in general
				distribution throughout the corporation. Some of the material contained in the
				series, primarily news clippings, originated in the corporate Information
				Center. The series is organized into seven subseries--<emph render="bold">General Office Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Clients</emph>,
				<emph render="bold">Media</emph>, <emph render="bold">Meetings</emph>,
				<emph render="bold">Mergers and Acquisitions</emph>, <emph render="bold">Offices</emph>, and <emph render="bold">People</emph>--and
				arranged alphabetically therein.</p>
               
               <p>Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were
				assigned consecutive numbers reflecting the order in which they were
				encountered. If a work has a corresponding or associated electronic file, the
				file is included in the container list. The contents of each disk have been
				migrated to the electronic records server. Consequently, the contents of these
				disks are available only in correspondingly numbered electronic subdirectories.
				Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic files.</p>

				  (media buying manuals, a media glossary, etc.), the bulk of the subseries
				  consists of a long run of weekly news clipping files,

                  <p>Presentations, speeches, photographs, and correspondence
				  relating to corporate and industry-wide meetings--including the American
				  Advertising Federation luncheons, the Pan-American CEO Institute Roundtable,
				  the Conference Board West Coast Marketing Symposium, and Bates' own Worldwide
				  Management Meetings. The
				  American Advertising Federation luncheons
				  honored two Bates executives (Rosser Reeves in 1994, William Backer in 1996)
				  who were inducted into their Advertising Hall of Fame. Two meetings, the
				  Pan-American CEO Institute Roundtable and
				  the
				  Conference Board West Coast Marketing
					 Symposium, both held in 1992, discussed the implications the newly
				  enacted
				  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
				  The two Worldwide Management Meetings reconsidered Bates' corporate brand
				  identity as a global advertising agency. The 1996 meeting, in particular,
				  focused on creative aspects of advertising and inaugurated the internal
				  <emph render="doublequote">Best of Bates</emph> competitions. (For more on this
				  competition, see the <emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph>).

               <p>In 1994,
				Backer Spielvogel Bates renamed itself
				Bates Worldwide and embarked on a project to
				create a new corporate brand identity as a global advertising agency. The new
				branding emphasized the creative aspects of advertising. It was a way of
				reinvigorating the concept of the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), Bates's
				traditional advertising philosophy--every successful product inherently
				contained a unique or compelling idea (or proposition) that made the product
				attractive to consumers, and successful advertising identified that unique idea
				and linked it to a consumer's life needs. This project led to the creation of a
				Global Creative Board and inaugurated an annual internal creative competition
				known variously as <emph render="doublequote">Best of Bates</emph> or
				<emph render="doublequote">Bates's Best,</emph> the first awards for which were
				given during the Worldwide Management Meeting in 1996. The Creative Department
				was charged with coordinating this yearly competition and helped in the
				selection of entries for various industry-wide awards competitions. </p>

				entry forms, memoranda, print advertisement proofs and photocopies, slides and
				printed material. The series dates between 1980s-2003, but most of the
				materials date from 1997-2002 and document the Creative Department's
				coordination of internal and external awards competitions, in particular the
				annual <emph render="doublequote">Best of Bates</emph> program. It includes a
				significant portion of international advertisements; however, the files do not
				represent the total output of Bates Worldwide offices. Rather, they reflect
				what Bates's various international offices considered their best work for the
				period covered herein. They provide a glimpse into some of Bates's
				international campaigns and creative output for clients such as Arnott's
				department store (Ireland), Audi/Volkswagen, Caltex, Camel cigarettes,
				Heineken, Le Meridien hotels, Land Rover, Nokia cellular phones, Pfizer, Royal
				Mail of Australia, Seat automobiles, and Thames bottled water. Many of the
				submission forms (some are still attached to the submitted item) for these
				competitive entries include a description of the USP that informed the
				advertisement's design. In addition, the series contains general files
				pertaining to other Creative Department operations and activities. </p>
               
               <p>The series is organized into three subseries--<emph render="bold">Creative Binders</emph>, <emph render="bold">Print
				Advertisements</emph> and <emph render="bold">Office Files</emph>--that reflect
				the various formats of materials in the series. Both the <emph render="bold">Creative Binders Subseries</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Print Advertisements Subseries</emph> contain examples of
				advertisements entered into competitive events, which are present in varying
				formats--slides, proofs, tear sheets, and photocopies. There is some redundancy
				to the container list: because of the various formats it was not feasible to
				house all materials pertaining to a specific client together. Thus, portions of
				the container list repeat client names.</p>

                  <p>Proof sheets and photocopies of print advertisements entered
				  into company-wide <emph render="doublequote">Best of Bates</emph> competitions.
				  Most are in color, many are large-format and several are mounted on foamboard
				  for presentation purposes. Specific clients listed below have more than two
				  images present; many other clients are represented in the collection by a
				  single image, but are not listed by name. International offices are heavily
				  represented in this subseries, but the materials present only reflect a portion
				  of the actual output of Bates global operations. For a more comprehensive
				  collection of Bates's domestic output, see the <emph render="bold">Print Books
				  Series</emph>. For ease of access, the subseries is organized into two
				  lists--chronological and alphabetical. </p>

               <p>Correspondence, letters of introduction, mailings, research
				reports, presentations and other printed materials. The series spans 1973-2003,
				but most of the materials fall between 1993 and 2003, and represent Bates'
				pursuit of new business accounts through its various New Business departments
				during the final decade of the company's existence. The series is organized
				into three subseries--General Files, Competing Agencies, and Companies--and
				alphabetically therein.</p>
               
               <p>Some large-format items have been removed to special boxes. Items
				have been linked to the pertinent subseries by a dummy file, which title
				appears in brackets.</p>
               
               <p>Audiovisual materials have been removed to the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph>. Originals are closed to use.
				Technical Services staff need to produce use copies before contents can be
				accessed. Please consult with Research Services staff before requesting
				audiovisual materials.</p>
               
               <p>Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were
				assigned consecutive numbers reflecting the order in which they were
				encountered. If a work has a corresponding or associated electronic file, the
				file is included in the container list. The contents of each disk have been
				migrated to the electronic records server. Consequently, the contents of these
				disks are available only in correspondingly numbered electronic subdirectories.
				Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic files.</p>

                  <p>Letters of introduction, correspondence, mailings, and
				  presentation materials that document Bates' active pursuit of new business.
				  Over 400 companies and/or products are represented, although most of the files
				  are limited to contact letters (feelers) that Bates' offices sent out to
				  prospective clients, along with some responses to requests for information and
				  follow-up communication. Some companies' files, however, are more extensive,
				  comprising research reports, credentials presentations, analyses of a
				  prospective client's competing products, and account planning strategies, and
				  provide a glimpse into the actual process Bates undertook to win new business
				  accounts. These companies include Amtrak, Bali Company, Bank of America, Bell
				  South, Chevron-Texaco, Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive, A.T. Cross, Delta
				  Airlines, IKEA, Jenny Craig, KPMG, Marconi PLC, Motorola, New York Lottery,
				  Nokia, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Parmalat, Petsmart,
				  Reckitt-Benckiser, Sara Lee Lingerie, Sunkist Growers, Inc., Unisys, the U.S.
				  Navy and WebMD. Arranged alphabetically by client name.</p>

               <p>Print proofs, tear sheets and photocopies of print advertisements
				maintained in print books by the Print Production Department, which was
				responsible for producing these advertisements in various sizes, colors, and
				shapes. Entries in the books were apparently made as the advertisements were
				created. The print books thus reflect Bates' domestic client roster over time
				and constitute a representative sampling of Bates' North American output for
				the years covered. (For examples of Bates' international work, see the
				<emph render="bold">Creative Department Series</emph>.) Major clients
				represented include
				Avis, Campbell's Soup Company, Carter-Wallace, Cunard
				  Lines, Foot Locker, Hyundai, Kal Kan, Lancaster, M&amp;M/Mars, Miller Brewing
				  Co., Paddington, Panasonic, Prudential-Bache, T. Rowe Price, Trans-World
				  Airlines (TWA), U.S. Navy, Warner-Lambert, Wendy's International, and
				  Westvaco. The files are organized into two lists--chronological and
				alphabetical. There is considerable date overlap in the chronological listings,
				largely due to the vaying durations of Bates' client relationships. </p>
