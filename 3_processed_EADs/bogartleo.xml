         <abstract>Leo Bogart was an
		applied sociologist and mass
		media expert who was Vice President and General Manager of the
		Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB) from
		1960-1989. In his career with the NAB, Bogart pioneered new methodologies in
		newspaper marketing research and
		led two major projects during the mid 1970s-1989 to bolster the ailing
		newspaper industry, the
		Newspaper Readership Project and the
		Future of Advertising Project. He was also a prolific author
		and public speaker, and published 195 articles and 14 books, and delivered over 150 speeches from
		1943-2005.
		 The Leo Bogart Papers span the years 1912-2005 and document Bogart's
		  professional work with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; as a mass media expert; and as an
		  author and public speaker.  The collection includes
		  correspondence, clippings, articles, speeches, books, journals, chapters, drafts, proposals,
		  notes, reports, scrapbooks, resumes, interviews, schedules, programs, pamphlets,
		  administrative records, research materials, publications, promotional materials, ephemera, yearbooks,
		  student papers, military records, photographs, negatives, and slides.
		  Materials represent Bogart's professional work as Vice President and General Manager of the
		  Newspaper Advertising Bureau, as well as his early employment with
		  Standard Oil (New Jersey), McCann-Erickson, and
		  Revlon, Inc.; as a prolific author and public speaker; as a Senior Fellow
		  with the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia
		  University; and as a mass media consultant
		  with the Innovation International Media Consulting Group. The bulk of files relate to research on U.S. markets, although some files do cover international research projects. Topics include newspaper marketing research; newspaper
		  readership; newspaper advertising; television and society; critiques of mass media;
		  social science research methodology; and international
		  newspapers in emerging markets. The collection also documents Bogart's early
    		  experiences as a student and as a soldier in the
		  U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, which formed the basis for several of his writing projects.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Leo Bogart Papers span the years 1912-2005 and document Bogart's professional work with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; as a mass media expert; and as an author and public speaker.  The collection includes correspondence, clippings, articles, speeches, books, journals, chapters, drafts, proposals, notes, reports, scrapbooks, resumes, interviews, schedules, programs, pamphlets, administrative records, research materials, publications, promotional materials, ephemera, yearbooks, student papers, military records, photographs, negatives, and slides. Materials represent Bogart's professional work as Vice President and General Manager of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, as well as his early employment with Standard Oil (New Jersey), McCann-Erickson, and Revlon, Inc.; as a prolific author and public speaker; as a Senior Fellow 		  with the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University; and as a mass media consultant with the Innovation International Media Consulting Group.  The bulk of files relate to research on U.S. markets, although some files do cover international research projects. Topics include newspaper marketing research; newspaper readership; newspaper advertising; television and society; critiques of mass media; social science research methodology; and international newspapers in emerging markets. The collection also documents Bogart's early experiences as a student and as a soldier in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, which formed the basis for several of his writing projects. </p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

               <p>The <emph render="bold">Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB) Subseries</emph> documents Bogart's
		  twenty-nine year executive career with the
		  Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB), the advertising
		  and marketing organization
		  for the newspaper industry. Bogart began work with
		  the NAB as Vice President of Marketing Planning and Research in 1960 and was promoted to Executive Vice
		  President and General Manager in 1966. Bogart was the architect of
		  many of the major research studies conducted during his tenure with the NAB. Bogart led two major
		  research projects,
		  the Newspaper Readership Project from 1977-1983 and the
		  Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988.
		  The goal of the Newspaper Readership Project was to make recommendations
		  to reverse declines in newspaper readership that begun in the 1920s and were
		  threatening the vitality of the newspaper
		  industry during the 1970s and 1980s.  The Future of Advertising Project was formed shortly
		  afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising revenues that began in the 1960s due
		  largely to the rise of television.  Recommendations from the Future of Advertising
		  Project led
		  to standardization in advertising formats and invoices across newspapers. This subseries
		  is divided into three sections: <emph render="bold">General</emph>, <emph render="bold">Newspaper
		  Readership Project</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Future of Advertising Project</emph>.
		  <emph render="bold">General</emph> consists mainly of materials related to various research projects at
		  the NAB. For slides of NAB presentations, see the
		  <emph render="bold">Photographs &amp; Slides Series</emph>. Speeches and presentations in this
		  subseries report directly on the workings of the NAB; for all other speeches, see the
		  <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph>.

               <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Service Subseries</emph> documents Bogart's membership and
		  service in professional
		  organizations and clubs and on committees and advisory boards.

		  Subseries</emph> consists of clippings, writings, and notes on various subjects that Bogart maintained

                  <p>After Bogart retired from the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, he was nominated a fellow with the
	   Gannett Center for Media Studies for the 1989-1990 academic year.
	   As a fellow, Bogart received support while completing
	   his book <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Commercial Culture: The Media System and the Public Interest</title>.
	   For materials related to this book,
	   see the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph>.
	   Bogart continued a relationship with the Gannett Center, which became financially independent
	   from the Gannett Broadcasting Group in 1991 and was renamed the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center.
	   On behalf of the Freedom Forum, Bogart advised the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Oakland Tribune</title> on how
	   to restructure their business in 1991 and organized a newspaper advertising workshop in Russia and Eastern
	    Europe in 1992. </p>
                  
                  <p>Bogart spent much of his late career sharing his newspaper industry and mass media expertise.
	   As Director and Senior Consultant for Innovation International Media Consulting Group,
           Bogart advised newspapers, particularly in Spain, Latin America, Russia, and Eastern Europe; and
	   assessed the state of newspapers and mass media for Innovation publications and conferences. Bogart also
	   shared his knowledge about the mass media with attorneys as a media expert in two very public trials in the
	   1990s,
	   <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Chandler v. Jackson</title> (Michael Jackson child molestation lawsuit) and
	   <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Valenzuela v. Hughes Aircraft Company</title> (TCE groundwater contamination
	   lawsuit in Tuscon, Arizona).</p>
                  
                  <p>Slides of presentations given at the Freedom Forum workshop and photographs of the trip are located in the
	   <emph render="bold">Photographs and Slides Series</emph>.
	   Presentation scripts are in Russian and English and slide text is in Russian.
	   Videocassette tapes of media coverage of
	   Michael Jackson and TCE groundwater contamination in Arizona are located in the
	   <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph> section. Arranged alphabetically.

                  <p>Documents Bogart's
		  twenty-nine year executive career with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB), the advertising
		  and promotion organization
		  for the newspaper industry. Bogart began work with
		  the NAB as Vice President of Marketing Planning and Research in 1960 and was promoted to Executive Vice
		  President and General Manager in 1966. During his tenure with the NAB, Bogart was the architect of
		  most of the major research studies. Bogart led two major research projects,
		  the Newspaper Readership Project from 1977-1983 and the Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988.
		  The goal of the Newspaper Readership Project was to make recommendations
		  to reverse declines in newspaper readership that begun in the 1920s and were
		  threatening the vitality of the newspaper
		  industry during the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising Project was formed shortly
		  afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising revenues that began in the 1960s due
		  largely to the rise of television.  Recommendations from the Future of Advertising Project led
		  to standardization in advertising formats and invoices across newspapers. This subseries
		  is divided into three sections: <emph render="bold">General</emph>, <emph render="bold">Newspaper
		  Readership Project</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Future of Advertising Project</emph>.
		  <emph render="bold">General</emph> consists mainly of materials related to various research projects at
		  the NAB. For slides of NAB presentations, see the
		  <emph render="bold">Photographs &amp; Slides Series</emph>. Speeches and presentations in this
		  subseries report directly on the workings of the NAB; for all other speeches, see the
		  <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph>.
		  Arranged alphabetically within category except for speeches and meetings, which are arranged
		  chronologically.
