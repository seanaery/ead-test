         <abstract>Austrian-born economist, policy maker, and diplomat; chair of U.S. Federal Reserve Board from 1970-1978 and economic advisor for six U.S. presidencies. The Arthur Frank Burns Papers cover the years 1911 through 2005. The bulk of the material was created between 1940 and 1987 and pertains to Burns's career as an economic advisor, particularly to Republican administrations, as the chair of the Federal Reserve, and as ambassador to Germany.  The collection is arranged into seven series: Correspondence, Honors and Awards, Journals, Personal Papers, Photographs, Print Materials, and Research and Teaching.  Topics of interest in this collection include but are not limited to: the United States economic system and fiscal policies; the Federal Reserve Board and related committees; recessions, unemployment, and inflation; the world economy and finance; the U.S. presidency during the time period; the Nixon presidency in particular, including the Watergate affair; presidential campaigns and elections; and U.S. diplomacy.  There is a limited amount of research and teaching material, chiefly from the 1920s-1930s.  The most significant component of the collection is the correspondence between Arthur Burns and Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Kennedy, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, as well as substantive exchanges with economists Milton Friedman and Wesley Clair Mitchell.  There are a few letters in German, French, and Russian.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>Arthur Frank Burns, renowned economist, policy maker and diplomat, was born into an Austro-Hungarian Jewish family in Stanislau, Galicia (now part of Ukraine) in 1904. His family immigrated to the United States in 1914 and settled in New Jersey. In 1925 Burns received A.B. and A.M. degrees in economics from Columbia University. He worked under renowned economist Wesley Clair Mitchell and received his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia in 1934. Between 1926 and 1944 he taught at Columbia and Rutgers. He was named full professor at Rutgers University in 1943. Burns's economic thought was inspired by Keynes, yet he believed that the Keynesian model was simplistic and totalistic as, according to Burns, each industry had its own cycle, hence government intervention should be taken selectively and upon detailed statistical analysis. Burns joined the National Bureau of Economics as Research Associate in 1930; in later years he served as the Director of Research (1945-1953), President (1957-1967), and Chairman (1967-1968) of this institution.</p>
         
         <p>Burns's political involvement with the Republican Party began with his support for Eisenhower in the 1952 election. Burns acted as the Chairman of the Council of Advisors to the President (1953-1956), Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Small Business (1956), and as member of U.S. Advisory Council on Social Security Financing (1957-1958).</p>
         
         <p>Burns was also an economic advisor to Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign and acted as the White House economic advisor from 1969-1970. He was appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve on Jan. 31, 1970, and held the position until March 1978. Meanwhile, he also served as the Head of the Committee on Interest and Dividends (1971-1974), a committee founded as part of Nixon's Economic Stabilization Program; as the U.S. Alternate Governor to the International Monetary Fund (1973-1978); and as a member of Emergency Loan Guarantee Board (1971-1978). The Nixon administration took over an economy in crisis, and Burns proposed a recovery program, which in the early days seemed to be effective. This period and Burns's reactions to its crises are well-documented in the correspondence and personal journals found in this collection. Between 1977-1981 and 1985-1987, Burns served as a distinguished scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy, where he taught and wrote. In 1981, Ronald Reagan appointed him U.S. Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, a position he held until May 16, 1985. Burns passed away on June 26, 1987 in Baltimore, Maryland. Burns's theories have inspired many economists, including his renowned student Milton Friedman.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Arthur Frank Burns Papers cover the years 1911 through 2005. The bulk of the material was created from 1940 to 1987 and pertains to Burns's career as an economic advisor, particularly to Republican administrations, as the chair of the Federal Reserve, and as ambassador to Germany. The collection is arranged into seven series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Honors and Awards, Journals, Personal Papers, Photographs, Print Materials</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Research and Teaching</emph>. There are also oversize materials housed at the end of the collection.  Topics of interest in this collection include but are not limited to: the United States economic system and fiscal policies; the Federal Reserve Board and related committees; recessions, unemployment, and inflation; the world economy and finance; the U.S. presidency during the time period; the Nixon presidency in particular, including the Watergate affair; presidential campaigns and elections; and diplomacy.  There is a small amount of research and teaching material, chiefly from the 1920s-1930s. The most significant component of the collection is the correspondence between Arthur Burns and Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Kennedy, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, as well as substantial exchanges with economists Milton Friedman and Wesley Clair Mitchell.</p>
         
         <p>The most substantial and notable papers are found in the <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>, which contains letters and memoranda written from 1911-1997 both to and from Burns and/or his wife, Helen. The series is organized into three subseries, <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Individual, Correspondence by Topic</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Correspondence to Mrs. Helen Burns</emph>. The majority of the exchanges in the first subseries are letters written to or by presidents or vice presidents (Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Spiro Agnew, Hubert Humphrey, and Nelson Rockefeller). Burns's correspondence with presidents Eisenhower and Nixon is particularly extensive and reveals the making of crucial policy decisions. Also included is Burns's correspondence with economists Wesley Clair Mitchell, Milton Friedman, and George Stigler. This subseries is organized alphabetically by correspondent and then chronologically.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Topic</emph> subseries contains letters and attachments primarily related to Burns's work in academia, politics, and the private sector. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence to Mrs. Helen Burns</emph> subseries contains letters written by prominent figures such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Mamie Eisenhower to Burns's wife, Helen, both during his life and after his death.</p>
         
         <p>High-value correspondence, including originals signed by presidents and some other notable correspondents, are separately stored and restricted to use except under direct staff supervision.  Photocopies of these original manuscripts have been made for researcher use.  Other letters signed by mechanical means have not been photocopied, but they are filed with the photocopies of original letters.  Many of the autographed original letters were scanned and migrated to a library server; to request access to these electronic copies, please contact a reference archivist in the Rubenstein Library before coming to use this collection.</p>
         
         <p>The other series house papers and memorabilia documenting Burns' career, including photocopies of two handwritten journals (1969-1974) kept by Burns during the Nixon Administration; several folders of early research and teaching materials; honors and awards received by Burns; personal correspondence, clippings, and other materials; lectures, speeches, and articles from Burns's career as economist and ambassador; photographs of Burns, his wife Helen, and political figures and celebrities attending events; publicity items such as news clippings, interviews, and articles about Burns; and program materials for the Arthur F. Burns Fellowship, an exchange program for German and U.S. media professionals.  Further description available at the series level in this collection guide.</p>
         
         <p>The great majority of the Burns papers are in English, but there are roughly ten items in German and a few items in French and Russian (Cyrillic script).</p>

               <p>Organized into three subseries. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Individual Subseries</emph> contains correspondence and memoranda between Burns and presidents, vice-presidents, politicians, and prominent economists. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence by Topic</emph> subseries contains letters and attachments primarily related to Burns' work in academia, politics, and the private sector. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence to Mrs. Helen Burns</emph> subseries contains letters written by figures such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Mamie Eisenhower to Burns's wife, Helen, both during his life and after his death. High-value correspondence is also represented by digital surrogates that are available for use.</p>
               
               <p>Although high-value correspondence can be accessed in several formats, the papers housed in boxes 1-3 are the only complete record of exchanges.  These boxes contain photocopies of high-value correspondence along with their original attachments, originals of other correspondence (including originals signed by mechanical means), and original onion-skin copies of Burns's out-going correspondence. Originals of high-value correspondence, without the corresponding attachments, are housed separately in box 16 and are closed to use.  Most of the letters from notable correspondents including U.S. presidents have also been scanned and migrated to a library server, but not all of the correspondence and attachments are represented. To request access to electronic copies, please contact a reference archivist in the Rubenstein Library before coming to use this collection.</p>

                  <p>Organized alphabetically by correspondent and then chronologically, the bulk of this subseries documents Burns's work with several presidential administrations. Correspondents include Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Spiro Agnew, Nelson Rockefeller, and Hubert Humphrey. The subseries also includes correspondence with his mentor, Wesley Clair Mitchell, and with his students, economists Milton Friedman and George Stigler. Burns's correspondence with presidents Eisenhower and Nixon constitute the most significant part of the subseries. These exchanges cover domestic economic matters such as recession, monetary and fiscal policies to regulate inflation and unemployment; international political and economic matters; and domestic political issues such as elections and party politics.</p>

                     <p>Burns continued to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board during the first year of the Carter administration. This correspondence documents Dr. Burns's work with the new administration especially on the matter of tax reform, along with budgetary issues and policies regarding OPEC. Burns presented his resignation to Jimmy Carter in January 1978. Included in the collection is a January 13, 1978 letter in which Carter accepts Burns's and expresses his appreciation of Burns's leadership of the Federal Reserve over the past eight years. The letters after January 1978 address non-economic issues such as Burns's receipt of the America's Democratic Legacy Award of the Anti-Defamation League and Carter's appreciation of Burns's support for his efforts in human rights. Two letters from Rosalynn Carter are also included.</p>

                     <p>Burns acted as the Chairman of the Council of Advisors to the President (1953-1956), Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Small Business (1956), and a member of U.S. Advisory Council on Social Security Financing (1957-1958) during the Eisenhower Administration. He played an especially crucial role in steering the implementation of anti-recession policies. Even after he resigned from the Council of Economic Advisors, he continued to counsel the president on economic matters.</p>
                     
                     <p>Topics in the correspondence include economic issues such as how to combat recession/depression and inflation, unemployment, budget planning, taxes, government expenditure, monetary policy, value of the dollar, and gold reserves. The letters also address U.S. domestic politics and international relations, such as the situation in Vietnam and Cuba and the Mutual Security Program. Burns's correspondence with Eisenhower continued after his term as the President ended in 1961; the topic of the correspondence shifts to personal notes and exchanges on general economic models and policies, evaluation of the Eisenhower period economic policies and assessment, and expresses criticism of economic, political and foreign policies of the administrations of the time.</p>

                     <p>Burns continued to be the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board during the Ford Administration. Ford's correspondence to Burns primarily consists of routine notes of appreciation for Burns's work, for having sent materials, for his comments on economic matters, and for his donation to the Ford Library. Also included are invitations, congratulations, and notes of regret. Burns's side of the correspondence expresses ideas regarding economic matters such as the ongoing recession, Federal Reserve policies, and the Financial Reform Act.</p>

                     <p>Arthur Burns was the economic advisor to Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign and acted as Counselor to the President (1969) for a year after the election. He was appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in February 1970. The Nixon-Burns correspondence sheds light on the controversial years of Nixon's presidency and illustrates disagreements within the government regarding monetary policy, Burns' resistance to the politicization of the Federal Reserve, and his complaints about the White House staff. Burns' personal journals, also part of this collection, provide important and complimentary insights to the issues addressed in the Burns-Nixon correspondence.</p>

                        <p>The correspondence from Arthur Frank Burns to Nixon covers the period during which Dr. Burns acted as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and is comprised of letters and memoranda sent to the president. Major issues addressed in the correspondence are economic measures to be taken in order to fight inflation and recession, the monetary policy that the Federal Reserve should pursue in accordance with the Economic Stabilization Act, the issue of wage and price controls, the gold crisis, the value of the dollar, and policies that the administration should implement concerning the international monetary situation.</p>
                        
                        <p>The letters provide important insights into the disagreements between the Nixon Administration and Chairman Burns with regards to the issues of money supply, the extent and strictness of wage and price controls, and international monetary policy. The letters also address political matters such as Burns' opinions about domestic politics, his complaints about some White House staff, and the Watergate Scandal. International economic and political matters such as the Vietnam War, the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, and US relations with Latin American countries are also mentioned in the correspondence. Burns's handwritten journals, 1969-1974, found in the Journals Series in this collection, compliment this set of correspondence.</p>

                     <p>Burns was U.S. Ambassador to Germany in the first Reagan administration; accordingly, some letters concern German-American relations. Most, however, are routine expressions of thanks or congratulations from President Reagan. Also included are briefly stated pieces of economic advice from Burns to Reagan.</p>

                        <p>Reagan's correspondence to Burns begins around the 1980 presidential election and accordingly includes many notes of thanks for support and economic advice during the campaign. Also included are Reagan's authorization of Burns as ambassador to Germany and notes on the federal deficit. Birthday wishes and congratulations upon receiving Jospeh Prize for Human Rights are also included.</p>

               <p>Contains photocopies of two notebooks handwritten by Arthur Burns between January 20, 1969 and July 25, 1974, when Burns was acting as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Nixon Administration. The journals are comprised of 235 pages, are chronologically ordered in seven folders, and are accompanied by transcripts. They provide invaluable insights into the economic concerns and policies of the period as well as the personal and professional relations among Burns and the White House staff, Cabinet members, and the President. Burns describes at length his interactions with and personal opinions about prominent political figures of the time such as Richard M. Nixon, John Connally, H. Robert Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell, Spiro Agnew, Henry Kissinger, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and George Shultz, among many others. The journals record Burns' changing opinions about President Nixon, including disagreements between Burns and the White House concerning issues such as monetary policy and wage and price controls, the Federal Reserve, and relations with international economic partners. Burns' writings also provide important insights into his and others' opinions regarding Watergate and the White House's response to it. Other topics include employment and presidential appointments. There are also entries that discuss the all-volunteer army, busing, community action programs, congressional testimony, energy, food stamps, the Headstart Program, housing, Job Corps, mass transit, malnutrition, model cities program, oil imports, revenue sharing, urban policy, welfare reform, and the Soviet immigration of Jews. There are often long time lapses between consecutive entries; however, Burns addresses the major developments during the time he did not write.</p>
               
               <p>The journals in this collection are photocopied from originals housed at the Ford Library. Since Burns' handwriting is difficult to read, Ford Library staff created transcripts which were then edited by Arthur F. Burns' former secretary, Gail Veenstra. Each photocopied page is accompanied by a transcript. Some words still remain illegible and are identified with brackets; any additional editing by Duke Library Staff is in pencil.</p>
