            <p>The Phyllis Chesler Papers contain sensitive information regarding persons other than
               Phyllis Chesler. Therefore, patrons who wish to use this collection must sign a

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of psychologist, radical feminist author, and professor Phyllis Chesler span
            the dates 1968-2001. For the most part, Chesler's original folder titles have been
            maintained throughout the collection. The collection is divided into the following
            series: <emph render="bold">Writings,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">Custody Speakout Project,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">Women and Health Organizations,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">Personal and Professional Papers,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">International Committee for Women of the Wall,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">On the Issues,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Chronic Fatigue
               Syndrome.</emph> Chesler's <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> are separated into
            subseries by titles of her published works, and comprise the bulk of the collection.
            These papers include research files, interviews, and chapter drafts for her books <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Women and Madness;</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Women, Money and Power;</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">About Men;</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">With Child;</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Mothers on Trial;</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sacred Bond;</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Letters to a
               Young Feminist</title>. The detailed research files in the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> also contain audiocassettes and selected transcripts of
            interviews conducted by Chesler in conjunction with her research on women and mental
            health, women's history, childbirth and pregnancy, child custody and surrogate mothers
            (particularly the "Baby M" controversy concerning Mary Beth Whitehead and the Stern
            family), and feminist concerns. The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> includes
            Chesler's miscellaneous writings and provides insight into her personal and professional
            life through correspondence, manuscripts, and notes surrounding each work as well as
            clippings and records documenting her feminist activism. Materials related to <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Women of the Wall: Claiming Sacred Ground</title> can be found in the
               <emph render="bold">International Committee for Women of the Wall Series</emph>.
            Chesler's complete writings from 1991 to the present, as well as selected archives of
            her writings from the 1970s and 1980s are available at her website, <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.phyllis-chesler.com/">The Phyllis Chesler Organization</extref>.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Personal and Professional Papers Series</emph> is subdivided
            into the following subseries:<emph render="bold">Teaching Material,</emph> which
            provides insight into Chesler's feminist activism and includes student evaluations and
            selected student papers for classes at the College of Staten Island and CUNY; <emph render="bold">Publicity Files,</emph> which contain reviews of Chesler's work as well
            as articles by and about her; <emph render="bold">Juvenilia,</emph> which documents
            Chesler's artistic and intellectual development through high school; <emph render="bold">People Files,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">Financial Papers,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">Correspondence,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Invitations.</emph>
            These latter four subseries document aspects of Chesler's personal and professional
            relationships and her family life. Among the major correspondents in the <emph render="bold">People Files Subseries</emph> are Carolyn Shaw Bell, Sheila Kaplan,
            Kate Millett, Tillie Olsen, Grace Paley, Adrienne Rich, Donna Shalala, Susan Sontag, and
            Gloria Steinem. The <emph render="bold">Custody Speakout Project Series</emph> and the
               <emph render="bold">Women and Health Organizations Series</emph> document Chesler's

                     <p>The materials in the subject files document Chesler's activism during the
                        Baby M trial as well as the research performed for <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sacred Bond.</title> Issues covered in these files include adoption,
                        surrogacy legislation, women's reproductive rights, and legal issues
                        surrounding surrogacy. This section also contains many clippings documenting
                        coverage of the Baby M trial and of other surrogacy and custody trials. The
                        folders are arranged in alphabetical order primarily using Chesler's folder
                        titles. </p>

                     <p>The Committee for Mary Beth Whitehead was founded by
                        Chesler during the "Baby M" trial as an agency to support the rights of Mary
                        Beth Whitehead, "Baby M's" birth mother. The papers in this section chiefly
                        document the administrative activities of this organization. The folders are
                        arranged alphabetically.</p>

                        </unitdate>(chiefly<unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"> 1970s</unitdate>), contains
                     correspondence, clippings, notes, and other miscellaneous materials related to
                     individuals and institutions with whom and which Chesler was in contact during
                     this period. Much of the material in the series documents Chesler's personal
                     and professional concerns following the publication of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Women, Money and Power</title> and prior to publication of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">About Men</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">With
                        Child,</title> with a particular emphasis on her relationships with other
                     feminist writers and activists. The folders are arranged by last name, except
                     for the small number where Chesler's original folder title referred to an
                     institution. These files are interfiled within the established alphabetical
                     order, maintaining Chesler's original order.</p>
