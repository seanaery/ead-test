         <abstract>North Carolina lawyer and federal judge. The legal and judicial papers of U.S. Circuit Court Judge James Braxton Craven span the years 1961-1977. Files of correspondence, memoranda, and legal motions and orders concern a multitude of cases in which Craven was involved.  Cases include civil suits; criminal cases, including many prisoners' petitions for Writs of Habeas Corpus, particularly since Gideon v. Wainwright; and appeals from administrative boards and commissions, including the FCC, SEC, NLRB, and others. After 1970, Craven served on "three-judge" district court sessions, special courts which usually relate to civil suits raising questions of governmental policy and of constitutional law, and the files document these as well. There are also files dating from 1964-1973 which concern school integration cases. The correspondence between judges is particularly significant, revealing the intersection of personal belief and the carrying out of judicial processes in the lower and higher courts. The collection also includes a précis outlining the legal philosophy and the highlights of Craven's career, but contains very little personal material.</abstract>

         <p>The legal and judicial papers of U.S. Circuit Court Judge James Braxton Craven span the years 1961-1977. Files of correspondence, memoranda, and legal motions and orders concern a multitude of cases in which Craven was involved.  Cases include civil suits; criminal cases, including many prisoners' petitions for Writs of Habeas Corpus, particularly since Gideon v. Wainwright; and appeals from administrative boards and commissions, including the FCC, SEC, NLRB, and others. After 1970, Craven served on "three-judge" district court sessions, special courts which usually relate to civil suits raising questions of governmental policy and of constitutional law, and the files document these as well. There are also files dating from 1964-1973 which concern school integration cases. The correspondence between judges is particularly significant, revealing the intersection of personal belief and the carrying out of judicial processes in the lower and higher courts. The collection also includes a précis outlining the legal philosophy and the highlights of Craven's career, but contains very little personal material. Arrangement is in one large alphabetical file, prefaced by a file of biographical information.</p>
