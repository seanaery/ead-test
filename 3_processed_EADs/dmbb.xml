         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles (DMB&amp;B) Archives consists of
		  advertising agency records spanning the years 1929 to 1995. The bulk of the
		  material dates from the 1950s to the mid-1980s. The Archives includes material
		  that documents aspects of three advertising agencies: D'Arcy Masius Benton
		  &amp; Bowles (DMB&amp;B), Benton &amp; Bowles (B&amp;B), and D'Arcy-MacManus
		  &amp; Masius (D-MM).</p>
         
         <p>The Archives as a whole provides a comprehensive overview of Benton
		  &amp; Bowles advertisements (1932-1995) and commercials (1950s-1980s), primarily
		  those created by the agency's New York office. Other major topics include the
		  advertising careers of William B. Benton and Atherton W. Hobler; research and
		  publication about the history of Benton &amp; Bowles by Gordon Webber and Frank
		  Smith; television programs created by B&amp;B in the 1950s; aspects of employee
		  training, recruitment, and management; and marketing research. The Archives
		  also documents the merger of the D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius agency with
		  Benton &amp; Bowles to form DMB&amp;B in 1985. There is very little information in the Archives about the
		  D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius agency prior to the merger. Also, material about
		  Benton &amp; Bowles offices other than New York is limited, and found mostly in
		  B&amp;B house organs.</p>
         
         <p>The D'Arcy-MacManus Masius Files comprise a very small amount of
		  materials in the Archives. Although the D'Arcy agency had its roots in 1906,
		  the Items gathered here date only from 1972-1985, mainly 1981 to 1985. They
		  consist of corporate publications, notes, and clippings. The 75th Anniversary
		  edition of
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Between Us</title> contains an overview of
		the history of D'Arcy-MacManus &amp; Masius, especially of the D'Arcy
		Advertising Company, and its clients.
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Profiles,</title> a resource book, provides
		information on all of the divisions of the D'Arcy -MacManus Masius Worldwide
		group of advertising agencies.</p>
         
         <p>The Benton and Bowles Files are by far the largest part of the
		  Archives. They include primarily print advertisements (the largest series in
		  the Archives), but also over 500 films, significant documents relating to the
		  work of the agency, photographs, and corporate publications. The Benton &amp;
		  Bowles Files span the years 1929 to 1985, although most of the material dates
		  from 1950s and after. Item types in the collection include internal memoranda;
		  reports; speeches; printed material (manuals, leaflets, pamphlets, and house
		  organs); photographs; research notes; credentials; employee training material;
		  press releases and clippings; book manuscripts; audio tapes of oral history
		  interviews; and financial papers. The Benton &amp; Bowles Files provide
		  documentation of the history of print and television advertising; television
		  programming; the history of the B&amp;B agency and its corporate culture;
		  corporate communications; marketing research; and advertising executives.</p>
         
         <p>The earliest Items in the B&amp;B Files are two small bank books
		  recording account activity of the fledgling agency from 1929 to 1935 and copies
		  of William (<emph render="doublequote">Billie</emph>) Benton's long letters to
		  his mother, 1929-1938, in which he confides details of his new advertising
		  agency as well as family matters. A small number of other Items date from the
		  1930s and 1940s and illustrate isolated aspects of the agency's business in
		  that period.</p>
         
         <p>Long series of various agency house organs begin in 1947 and provide
		  the most complete and continuous views of Benton &amp; Bowles, its clients,
		  advertising campaigns, personnel, and various offices in the U.S. and
		  abroad.</p>
         
         <p>The Advertisements Series is the largest section
		  of the Archives and contains comprehensive files of print advertising campaigns
		  developed mainly by  Benton &amp; Bowles from 1932-1980. The Series includes primarily proofs,
		  along with some tearsheets, of consumer and trade advertisements, most from
		  U.S. magazines and newspapers. Files for a few clients include unusual
		  material, such as packaging or client newsletters. Most of the advertisements
		  were removed from large scrapbooks into which B&amp;B employees had pasted
		  them; many have suffered glue damage, but they remain an invaluable source for
		  studying the development of a number of advertising campaigns over long periods
		  of time. Longtime clients of B&amp;B included Procter &amp; Gamble and General
		  Foods, among many others. Neither the Advertisements Series nor any other part
		  of the Archives contains substantial documentation of the creative processes
		  behind the advertisements and advertising campaigns.</p>
         
         <p>For additional information about the Advertisements Series, see the
		  data collection sheets in the Information Folders about the DMB&amp;B Archives.
		  The data collection sheets provide notes about: languages, other than English,
		  used in the advertisements; countries, other than the United States, for which
		  advertisements were produced; the use of celebrities in the advertisements;
		  themes or social and political issues that can be studied in the
		  advertisements; and the use of comic illustrations. The data collection sheets
		  also note the existence of collateral literature for certain advertising
		  campaigns. The Information Folders also contain a list of Benton &amp; Bowles
		  clients and the dates of agency-client relationships. </p>
         
         <p>The Audiovisual Series (RESTRICTED) contains over
		  500 reels of 16mm film varying in lengths from 200' to 1600'. The majority of
		  the films are compilations of commercials created mainly by Benton &amp; Bowles for
		  many different clients. Also included are several dozen reels of vintage
		  television programs (shows created or sponsored by B&amp;B), several
		  stockholders' meetings, speeches, new business presentations, and outtakes. At
		  the time of this writing, most of the films have not been viewed in their entirety,
		  indexed, or reformatted. However, a selection of films has been reformatted for research use.</p>
         
         <p>Addition (accession #2001-0103) (554 items, 7.5 linear ft.; dated [ca.
		  1950s]-[1980s]) comprises 16-mm film reels of commercials. Brand names and
		  clients include Crest, Post cereals, Scope, Yardley, Hardees, Grape Nuts,
		  Hasbro, and Pampers. Viewing of commercials is restricted until videocassette
		  use copies are made. For a container list, contact a Reference Archivist. </p>

Many of the stories about advertising campaigns center on human interest factors, such as the role of an actor in a commercial or a company event that launched the campaign. Organized into three sections: <emph render="bold">House Organs</emph>, <emph render="bold">Credentials</emph>, and Press Releases. The <emph render="bold">Credentials</emph> were created by Benton &amp; Bowles to give prospective clients a general overview of the company and its services. House Organs focus primarily on news about the company, but also include a considerable amount of information about clients and advertising campaigns, management, domestic and international offices of Benton &amp; Bowles subsidiary companies, corporate research, other advertising agencies, and various business, social, and personal activities of Benton &amp; Bowles employees. The <emph render="bold">Press Releases</emph> include news about management changes, research reports, and clients.  Credentials are arranged chronologically; House Organs, in alphabetical order by title, then chronologically; and Press Releases are in chronological order.
