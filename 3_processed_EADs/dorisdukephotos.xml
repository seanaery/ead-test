         <abstract>Doris Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke, a founder of the American Tobacco Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of Duke University, and Nanaline Holt Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in 1925, which included Duke Farms in New Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a mansion in New York City, Doris was soon dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the world." Although Doris did her best to live a private life, she carried on the Duke family's pattern of philanthropy by contributing to a number of public causes such as the arts, historic preservation, and the environment. Doris Duke died in October 1993 at the age of 80. In her will she left the majority of her estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The Doris Duke Photograph Collection was created by combining color and black and white photographs, slides, negatives, and other photographic formats contained in albums, boxes, picture frames, and envelopes.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Doris Duke Photograph Collection was created by combining color and black and white photographs, slides, negatives, and other photographic formats contained in albums, boxes, picture frames, and envelopes into groupings closely mirroring the collections that constitute the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Historical Archives. The collection covers the years 1870 to 2006 and is organized into twelve series: Doris Duke, Duke Endowment, Duke Farms, Duke Gardens, Duke Family, Falcon Lair, General, New York Apartments/New York Mansion, Newport Restoration Foundation, Rough Point, Southeast Asian Art and Culture (SEAAC), and Shangri La.</p>

               <p>This series documents Doris Duke's life from the time she was an infant to a few years before and after her death in 1993. The photographs, slides, and negatives are grouped by topic and therefore do not always share the same creation date nor are they necessarily the same formats. Topics include social events, passport photos, life at her various residences, travel, her time as a war correspondent, her honeymoon, her many animals at the various residences, and her jewelry and dresses. Of particular interest are the color glass mounted slides of Doris Duke's trip to the Middle East in 1938.</p>

               <p>The images in this series document the transformation of the Duke Farms estate, including original construction and improvements made to the estate. This series primarily consists of black and white and color photographs that detail exterior shots around the estates (including fountains, statues, lakes, bridges and vistas), work on the estate, interior and exterior shots of the main residence and other buildings on the estate, aerial shots, camels Baby and Princess, who spent their summers at the estate, and various events at Duke Farms. Of particular interest are the tinted photographs of Duke Farms scenes dating from the early 1900s.</p>

               <p>The photographs and slides in this series document the history of the gardens from its inception to its dissolution. Subjects include the construction phases of transforming the greenhouses to display gardens, repair work to the display gardens, interior shots of the various display gardens (including flowers, statues, fountains, etc.), and a fashion photo shoot in Duke Gardens in 1964. Of particular interest are the color slides and View-Master "reels" of Duke Gardens that were available for purchase.</p>

The subjects of the images vary widely and include photographs of intimates, friends, and acquaintances of Doris Duke, portraits of unknown men and women, dogs at various estates, unknown buildings and gardens, inventories of furniture and art objects, and reproductions of photographs mounted on foam core that were used for various exhibits. Of particular interest are the black and white stereoscopic image manufactured by the Keystone Stereoscopic Service. These were most likely used by Doris Duke to help strengthen her vision.</p>

               <p>This series documents Doris Duke's life in Hawaii.
