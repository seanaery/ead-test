         <abstract>George P. Garrett (1929-2008) was a poet, editor, author, and professor of English. The papers of George P. Garrett span the years 1929 to 2000 with the bulk of the material being dated between 1960 and 1990. The papers were initially collected and assembled by author, bibliographer, and publisher Stuart T. Wright. Wright published a number of Garrett's works at his Palaemon Press and also assembled the Stuart Wright Bibliographic Collection of George Garrett (see related materials held by the Rubenstein Library). Additional materials were received by the Library directly from George Garrett. The papers document Garrett's literary career as an author of novels, short stories, poetry, and dramatic works (including filmscripts) and the tremendous influence he had as an English professor and an editor on an entire generation of writers, particularly in the South. Correspondence with numerous authors, publishers, and educators offers much information about the history of 20th-century Southern literature, publishing, and literary education. The collection is divided into the Writings Series (with subseries of Writings by Garrett, Writings Edited by Garrett, Writings by Others, and Proofs); the Correspondence Series (with 5 subseries of alphabetically and chronologically arranged correspondence); the Audiovisual Material Series; and the Miscellaneous Papers Series.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of George P. Garrett span the years 1929 to 2000 with the bulk of the material being dated between 1960 and 1990. The papers were initially collected and assembled by author, bibliographer, and publisher Stuart T. Wright. Wright published a number of Garrett's works at his Palaemon Press and also assembled the Stuart Wright Bibliographic Collection of George Garrett (see related materials held by the Rubenstein Library). Additional materials were received by the Library directly from George Garrett.</p>
         
         <p>The collection primarily documents Garrett's literary
		  career as an author of novels, short stories, poetry, and
		  dramatic works (including filmscripts) and the tremendous
		  influence he had as an English professor and an editor on
		  an entire generation of writers, particularly in the South.
		  Correspondence with numerous authors, publishers, and
		  educators offers much information about the history of
		  20th-century Southern literature, publishing, and literary
		  education. The collection is divided into the Writings
		  Series (with subseries of Writings by Garrett, Writings
		  Edited by Garrett, Writings by Others, and Proofs); the
		  Correspondence Series (with 5 subseries of alphabetically
		  and chronologically arranged correspondence); the
		  Audiovisual Material Series; and the Miscellaneous Papers
		  Series.</p>
         
         <p>The Alphabetical Correspondence Subseries: Group A
		  contains letters from numerous contemporary American
		  authors, among them Madison Smartt Bell, who wrote
		  regarding the progress of his fiction, his experience with
		  publishers and literary agents, and his interview with
		  Garrett for 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Paris Review;</title> and Fred
		Chappell, whose letters provide commentary on his own works
		
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Inkling</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Dagon</title> as well as
		praise for Garrett's 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Death of the Fox,</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Magic Striptease,</title>
		and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Welcome to the Medicine
		  Show.</title> The Writings by Others Subseries contains
		Bell's interview with Garrett, in which Garrett discusses
		his writing process, and critical essays by Fred Chappell
		(including one on Garrett's 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Stranger in the
		  Mirror</title> and one on the work of Sylvia Wilkinson).
		The Proofs Subseries contains a proof of Reynolds Price's 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Collected Stories,</title>
		with brief comments by Garrett.</p>
         
         <p>Garrett's own literary career is documented
		  throughout the collection. The Writings by Garrett
		  Subseries contains manuscripts, typescripts, notes, and
		  drafts of his work, some of it bearing notes for revision.
		  The Chronological Correspondence Subseries contains letters
		  in which Garrett wrote about his works in progress and
		  letters from friends and publishers regarding his work. The
		  comments of noted literary figures regarding Garrett's work
		  frequently appear in letters in the Alphabetical
		  Correspondence Subseries: Group A. This series also affords
		  researchers a detailed view of literary criticism and
		  support exchanged between Garrett and the many authors
		  represented in the collection. His negotiations with
		  publishers are best documented in the Alphabetical
		  Correspondence Subseries: Group B. The Audiovisual Material
		  Series contains some recordings of Garrett reading from his
		  own work.</p>
         
         <p>The Audiovisual Material Series, which contains
		  many recordings of Garrett's lectures, classes, and
		  addresses to groups of writers, students, and literary
		  scholars, documents Garrett's teaching style and his ideas
		  on the teaching of writing. 
		   Recordings of lectures and
		  readings by many other well-known authors also appear in
		  this series. Garrett's impact on his students and fellow
		  authors is again visible in the Writings by Others
		  Subseries, which consists of numerous manuscripts,
		  typescripts, and drafts (some bearing notes by Garrett) of
		  work sent to Garrett for commentary and revision. </p>
