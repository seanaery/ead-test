               <p>Processing Notes: Gergen labeled many of the original boxes with numbers or written clarifications of their contents. The archivist kept these as the general type or subject of the processed boxes, even if the box did not seem to contain material related to the description on the outside. In cases where it was possible to discern the general content of miscellaneous, incorrectly labeled, unlabeled, or loose documents at either a box or folder level, that was done (often using brackets) while also keeping Gergen's labels. Folders have also been marked <emph render="doublequote">[Loose Material]</emph> or <emph render="doublequote">[Unlabeled Material]</emph> to maintain original order as much as possible. These folder titles, however, are not included in the box list. A supplementary container list provides greater intellectual access by rearranging the consecutively-numbered boxes of this list into broad subject categories. It is appended to this document.</p>

               <p>Attention: Some of the materials in this collection are not immediately accessible, because they require further processing before use. Please contact Research Services staff before visiting the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library to use the collection. </p>
               
               <p> Processing Note: Gergen labeled many of the original boxes with numbers or written clarifications of their contents. We have kept these as the general type or subject of our processed boxes, even if the box does not seem to contain material related to the description on the outside. In cases where it was possible to discern the general content of miscellaneous, incorrectly labeled, unlabeled, or loose documents at either a box or folder level, we have done so (often using brackets) while also keeping Gergen's labels. Folders have also been marked <emph render="doublequote">[Loose Material]</emph> or<emph render="doublequote">[Unlabeled Material]</emph> to maintain original order as much as possible. These folder titles, however, are not included in the box list. A supplementary container list provides greater intellectual access by rearranging the current box numbers of this list into their original numbered series of boxes as imposed by Gergen . It is appended to this document. </p>
               
               <p>Furthermore, please be aware that this collection is unprocessed. Items have not been refoldered, flattened, or rehoused; rusty paperclips and some mildew may remain on the materials; and sensitive materials have not been removed or separated from the collection.</p>
