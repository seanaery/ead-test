               <p>Series contains 488 negative images. The bulk are negative strips, but there are also larger single negatives cut by the photographer. Among the negatives are images that represent the photographic prints in the collection, but there are also many negative images for which prints do not exist, including images of locations in Durham city and county. Original titles supplied by photographer were taken from envelopes or sleeves; titles supplied by library staff are in brackets.</p>
