         <abstract>Assembled by the staff of the Duke University Medical Library, the History of Medicine Picture File dates from the 1500s to 2002 and offers thousands of small and large images of individuals, places, and subjects, with the great majority portraying physicians, scientists, nurses, and other individuals related to the history or practice of medicine.  Places featured include hospitals and other institutions of medicine, and scenes related to events in medical history.  Subject categories include advertising, anatomy, books, caricatures, childbirth, embryology, medical instruments, pediatrics, physicians, and surgery, among many others.  The predominant formats are engravings, lithographs, print materials (such as posters, clippings, and postcards), and modern photographic prints, but there are also albumen photographs, negatives, and other image formats found throughout the files.  Items were acquired by the Duke Medical Library from various sources over many decades and functioned as a vertical file for library students and researchers.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Assembled by the staff of the Duke University Medical Library, the History of Medicine Picture File offers thousands of images of individuals, places, and subjects dating from the 1500s to 2002, with the great majority portraying physicians, scientists, nurses, and other individuals related to the history or practice of medicine.  Places featured include hospitals and other institutions of medicine, and scenes related to events in medical history.  Subject categories include advertising, anatomy, books, caricature, childbirth, embryology, medical instruments, pediatrics, physicians, and surgery, among many others.</p>
         
         <p>Most of the images measure in size under 10 x 12 inches, but there are approximately 500 larger pieces.  The predominant formats are engravings, lithographs, cartoons, clippings from magazines and newspapers, and modern photographic prints, but there are also albumen photographs and other image formats found throughout the files.  Items were acquired by the Duke Medical Library from various sources over many decades and functioned as a vertical file for library students and researchers.</p>
         
         <p>The oversize items range in size from 11 x 15 to 23 x 30 inches, and offer a varied assemblage of portraits, caricatures, posters, broadsides, and reproductions of artwork, in black-and-white and in color. Items include portraits and scenes with notable physicians; illustrations of various medical practices, procedures, and instruments; anatomical views, some possibly as early as the 17th century; medical advertisements and promotional literature; depictions of events in medical history in Europe and North America; caricatures; 20th century illustrations for book covers; and many other topics.</p>
         
         <p>Images and prints are often accompanied by reproduction negatives and slides created by Medical Center Library staff.  Many of the images in this collection were also scanned by Medical Library staff and are available through the Medical Center Library &amp; Archives <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://medspace.mc.duke.edu/search/site/01470">Duke Medicine Digital Repository database</extref>.

               <p>Series contains images of significant anatomists, chemists, physicians, biologists, and other individuals in the field of medicine, arranged alphabetically by last name.  Most depict 19th century men, primarily from European nations, particularly Germany, England, France, and Italy, and from North America, but there are also individuals active as early as the 15th century and as late as the 20th century.  In many cases there are multiple images of the same individual in the folder.</p>
               
               <p>The predominant formats are engravings, lithographs, modern black-and-white photographs, and printed images (chiefly clippings on glossy paper), but there are other formats present such as albumen prints and negatives.  Oftentimes the image is a modern photographic reproduction of an engraving, painting, sculpture, or other work.  Images are also often accompanied by a slide or negative reproduction created as far back as the 1960s by Duke University Medical Center Library staff.  Sizes range from small prints ranging from 2 x 3 to 10 x 12 inches, to oversize items of up to 23 x 30 inches.  The sizes of oversize boxes are given in the container inventory.</p>

               <p>Series contains images, chiefly engravings and lithographs, of various practices, events, and themes related to the history of medicine.  Arranged in alphabetical order by subject, and by box number within.  The series is arranged by original topical groupings designated by library staff; new groups were also added for additions to the collection. The current divisions are: <emph render="bold">Advertisements; Anatomy; Apothecary Jars; Baths; Bindings; Bloodletting; Books, Texts, and Illustrations; Buildings; Cardiology; Caricature; Cartoons; Cemeteries; Chemistry; Childbirth; Circumcision; Embryology; Hospitals; Infant Care; Leeches; Manikins; Man, Medicine, and Work; Medical Chests; Medical Costumes; Medical Devices; Military Medicine; Miscellaneous; Natural Science; Nurses and Nursing; Operating Rooms; Pediatrics; Pharmacies; Physicians; Postcards; Psychology; Stages in the Growth of Modern Medicine</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Surgery</emph>.  The largest series are Anatomy, Caricatures, Physicians, and Surgery.</p>
               
               <p>As with other series, the predominant formats are engravings and other printed items (including postcards, posters, broadsides, and clippings), and 20th century photographic images, often reproductions of printed works.  Images are also often accompanied by a slide or negative reproduction created by Medical Library staff as far back as the 1960s.  Sizes range from small prints under 10x12 inches, to oversize items of up to 23x30 inches.  The dimensions of oversize boxes are given in the container inventory.</p>
               
               <p>Many of the items have been digitized and can be found through the Medical Center Library &amp; Archives <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://medspace.mc.duke.edu/vital/access/manager/Community/vital:2">Historical Images in Medicine (HIM) database</extref>.
