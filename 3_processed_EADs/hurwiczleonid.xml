         <abstract>Leonid Hurwicz (1917-2008) was Regents’ Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Minnesota and recipient of the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for his work on mechanism design. The bulk of the Leonid Hurwicz papers span the years 1930-2008, covering his entire career as an economist, from his early work in the 1940s and 1950s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Chicago, and the Cowles Commission, until his death in 2008. The collection is arranged in the following series: Correspondence, Personal Files, Printed Materials, Professional Service, Research and Writings (about 70% of the collection), and Teaching Materials. Though there are correspondence, legal, financial, and other papers relating to Hurwicz's forced migration to the United States, there have been no items discovered documenting his training as an economist at the University of Warsaw or at the London School of Economics in the 1930s.  The majority of the collection focuses on Hurwicz's work after 1970, most notably his collaborations with Stanley Reiter, Kenneth Arrow, Don Saari, Thomas Marschak and Marcel Richter.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The bulk of the Leonid Hurwicz Papers span the years 1930-2008, covering his entire career as an economist in the United States, from his early work at MIT, the University of Chicago and the Cowles Commission until his death while Emeritus Professor at the University of Minnesota. The collection is arranged in the following series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Personal Files, Printed Materials, Professional Service Series, Research and Writings</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials</emph>. Though there are correspondence, legal, financial, and other papers documenting his migration to the United States, there have been no items discovered that document his training as an economist at the University of Warsaw or at the London School of Economics. The majority of the collection focuses on Hurwicz's work after 1970, most notably his collaborations with Stanley Reiter, Kenneth Arrow, Don Saari, Thomas Marschak and Marcel Richter. </p>
         
         <p>Though there is a significant amount of personal and professional correspondence, the majority of the papers reside in the 142 boxes of the <emph render="bold">Research and Writings Series</emph>, which contains extensive files of Hurwicz's research notes, reprints, and revisions of working papers by Hurwicz and others with added annotations. The research files document important developments in postwar mathematical economics and Hurwicz's seminal contributions to this field of study.</p>
         
         <p>Recurring subjects in Research and Writings include Cowles-style econometrics; the stability of general equilibrium; the integrability of demand functions; the study of monopolies and oligopolies, as well as socialized systems; decision-making under ambiguity; the second welfare theorem; the applications of game theory to economic, social and political issues; and the development of mechanism design, for which Hurwicz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007. With his theories on mechanism design (including the notion of incentive-compatibility), Hurwicz analyzed the functioning of institutions and communication systems such as banking, auctions, and privatized markets, and compared political systems such as socialism and capitalism.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to documenting Hurwicz's work in theoretical economics, the collection also follows his professional activities at the University of Minnesota, both as a teacher and as an active member of the Economics Department, his participation on various committees, and his work with institutions such as the Cowles Commission, RAND corporation, the National Science Foundation, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Also in evidence is Hurwicz's interest in the development of foreign economies, with an emphasis on East Asia, Russia, and Eastern Europe. His numerous travels and presentations during his career as well as his continuous relations with European and Asian economists are documented chiefly in the <emph render="bold">Professional Service Series</emph>. Finally, the <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph> as well as the <emph render="bold">Research and Writings Series</emph> offer a significant amount of works by others documenting the development of recent economics. Many are heavily annotated by Hurwicz.</p>
         
         <p>Electronic files which were readable have been transferred to the electronic records server. They consist chiefly of word processing documents containing drafts of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Informational Efficiency,</title> which Hurwicz co-authored with Reiter in the late 1990s. A use copy of original electronic files must be made before contents can be accessed; please contact a reference archivist before coming to use this material.</p>
         
         <p>Detailed descriptions on the arrangement and content of each series can be found in the respective sections in this collection guide.</p>

               <p>Consists of two groupings of professional correspondence maintained by Hurwicz, chiefly from the 1970s and 1980s; there is electronic email as well dating from approximately 1998-2008. There is no significant difference between the two subseries of papers, except that the first is more focused on the 1980s and the second chiefly on the period from 1977-1979. The two collections overlap occasionally. There are a few attached reprints or notes. The files are arranged alphabetically by senders or recipients, or by subject.</p>
               
               <p>Though the files contain extensive correspondence between Hurwicz and his colleagues, these exchanges are for the most part routine and contain few extended conversations on economics. Original folder titles are retained. Additional and perhaps more significant correspondence may be found in the Research Files (particularly in the Arrow, Marschak, Reiter and Uzawa files), as well as in the Professional Service Series. A small but significant amount of correspondence regarding Hurwicz's immigration and earliest years in the United States is located in the Personal Files Series - much of this in Polish.</p>

               <p>Series includes early letters, memorabilia, and other items documenting Hurwicz's migration to the U.S. from Poland and his early years in the U.S. (1939-1946); curriculum vitae; press clippings and articles; Nobel Prize memorabilia; and obituaries following his death in 2009. Languages include French and Polish. Included are documents from Hurwicz's early student years in Poland and at the London School of Economics, as well as early papers from his first positions in the U.S.  Many of the letters written in Polish to Hurwicz in the early 1940s appear to be from his father and other family members, who, with Hurwicz's efforts, also emigrated to the U.S. after he had established himself in the U.S.  Folders and their contents have been kept mostly in original order as filed by Hurwicz.  Arranged alphabetically by folder title, with the correspondence in chronological order.</p>

               <p>Consists chiefly of reprints and working papers, generally bound printed materials with a few annotations. Hurwicz's reprints and working papers are arranged in chronological order. Printed materials by colleagues are arranged by alphabetical order of the first author's last name. Though these are mainly articles, they also include PhD dissertations, reports or memoranda which are arranged alphabetically by author's name or by the institution for which it was written. The series also contains a full box of various brochures (economics departments, conference programs) and a box filled with unidentified papers in Russian. </p>

               <p>Represents approximately seventy percent of the collection. Contains notes, drafts, working papers, reprints, annotated manuscripts, faxes and letters related to Hurwicz's work as an economist. These papers span Hurwicz's entire career from his work with Kenneth Arrow and Hiro Uzawa at Cowles in the 1940s on the stability of general equilibrium and the integrability of demand functions, to his collaboration with Stanley Reiter on <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Designing Economic Mechanisms</title> (2006).</p>
               
               <p>For the most part, Hurwicz's original arrangement and folder titles have been retained.  The materials are ordered into two subseries: <emph render="bold">Topical</emph> and <emph render="bold">Other Research</emph>.  Roughly half of the Research and Writings series (51 boxes) is arranged in a <emph render="bold">Topical Subseries</emph>.  File folders represent either an important topic within Hurwicz's work or an extended collaboration with a colleague; there are also geographical files, including one on China. Within folders, materials are arranged in rough chronological order. There are also three boxes of correspondence related to works by others and seven boxes of unbound annotated works by others (in contrast with those included with the Printed Materials series, these are unbound and some are unpublished).</p>
               
               <p>Ninety-one other boxes in the <emph render="bold">Other Research Subseries</emph> contain files that have retained their original order as received by the library and have been given basic processing and arrangement.  The descriptions are broad, with significant topics or individuals highlighted; not all folders are represented.  There are a number of files related to geographical headings, especially relating to the economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and in smaller degree to Poland and New Zealand. Hurwicz also was interested in refugees and public policy, and this is reflected by folders of material on that subject.

                     <p>These papers document Hurwicz's works in relation with Thomas Marschak (no relation to Jacob Marshak). They contain drafts and notes on collaborative works as well as reprints of Marschak's works with annotations by Hurwicz. Most of their collaboration took place during the 1980s and dealt with mechanism design (dimensional requirements, resource allocations mechanisms). Arranged chronologically.</p>

                     <p>Hurwicz's collaboration with Stanley Reiter and Donald Saari represents a significant part of the Research and Writings Series. Spanning over three decades, those are very dense research materials including numerous projects, drafts, revisions, book chapters, proofs and presentations in seminars and conferences. The main output of this collaboration is Hurwicz and Reiter's <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Designing Economic Mechanisms</title>, published in 2006. Preliminary work in relation with this book begins by 1978. Those papers are divided in two subseries: the Reiter collaboration and the HRS collaboration. HRS seems to be mostly a subdivision of the work by Hurwicz and Reiter, with added commentaries by Saari. Numerous drafts of book chapters with a similar aspect can be found with numerous annotations and subtle differences. One may find seemingly similar materials in the H/R files (11 boxes) on one hand and in the H/R/S files (12 boxes) on the other hand.</p>
                     
                     <p>The material, dealing with mechanism design, is heavily mathematical with an extensive use of geometric techniques - annotated reprints of Spivak's <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Differential Geometry</title> are included. Recurring themes are the rectangle method and the condensation theorem. Beside collaborative works, these papers include other works by Reiter and Saari, with light annotations by Hurwicz and/or related correspondences. Each subseries is arranged in chronological order.</p>

                  <p>Chiefly consists of Hurwicz's research notes and drafts relating to projects and collaborations; correspondence folders; reprints, articles, and other writings by other economists, scientists, and students; conference records; and other mixed papers.  May also contain some personal papers and teaching materials.  Early dates refer chiefly to reprints and articles, often accompanied by Hurwicz's notes on those early works.  Topics covered by research notes and other materials vary, but focus chiefly on mathematical equations and modeling for institutional change, equilibrium, mechanism design, convergence, and condensation. There are many folders with materials relating to Hurwicz's collaborations with Stan Reiter. At least several folders of materials from the 1990s and early 2000s focus on Indian, Eastern European and Russian economic changes.</p>
