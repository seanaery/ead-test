         <abstract>The non-profit agency International Monitor Institute (IMI) operated between 1993 and 2003, primarily to assist international war-crimes tribunals by collecting, indexing and organizing visual evidence of violations of international human rights law. The International Monitor Institute Records span the dates 1986-2006, and primarily comprise audiovisual materials related to IMI’s documentation of contemporary conflicts and human rights violations around the world. Countries represented include: Burma (Myanmar), Bosnia and Hercegovina, Cambodia, Kuwait, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Thailand. Includes master and use copies of approximately 6000 videocassettes and 100 audio tapes and audiocassettes. The video and audio material is indexed by an extensive database developed by IMI which includes keywords, air dates, segment producer, segment title, and in some cases, transcripts and stills from the video. There are also many photographs and slides taken in the same regions, depicting destruction in areas of conflict, forced labor, refugees and refugee camps, and protests. The majority of the photos were taken on the Burma/Thai border, in Bosnia and Hercegovina, and refugee camps in Rwanda. Finally, there are extensive organizational records, including an extensive database of the audiovisual components. Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive.

         <p>The International Monitor Institute (IMI) was founded in 1993 by actress and film producer Pippa Scott. Scott, daughter of screenwriter Allan Scott who wrote some of the Astaire-Rogers films, was educated in California and in England, at Radcliffe College and the Southern California Institute of Architecture. Ms. Scott acted in such films as <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Searchers</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Auntie Mame,</title> and was a founding partner of the Emmy-award winning television company Lorimar Productions (producer of such TV hits as <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Waltons</title> and <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Dallas</title>). Scott established Linden Productions in 1987 to develop documentaries focusing on current issues. Linden's latest production is <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">King Leopold's Ghost,</title> a documentary about the exploitation of the Congo by King Leopold II of Belgium. Scott was a member of the Women's Refugee Commission, the Pacific Council on Foreign Relations, and the Los Angeles World Affairs Council.</p>

         <p>The International Monitor Institute was founded in 1993 and operated until 2003. Its primary mission was to assist international war-crimes tribunals by collecting, indexing and organizing visual evidence of violations of international human rights law. Videos and audiotapes were acquired through donation as well as on collecting trips by IMI associates in the former Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Cambodia, and other countries. IMI's activities also included developing regional archives of videos on conflict and human rights abuses, producing film and multimedia projects to assist humanitarian organizations, organizing public outreach events, conducting video research for governments, film makers, authors, and students, and providing educational outreach. Patrons and partners of IMI and its collections included the International Criminal Court and its staff, Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the governments of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia, and former First Lady Hillary Clinton.</p>

Countries represented include: Burma (Myanmar), Bosnia and Hercegovina, Cambodia, Kuwait, Iraq, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Thailand. Includes master and use copies of approximately 6000 videocassettes and 100 audio tapes and audiocassettes. The video and audio material is indexed by an extensive database developed by IMI which includes keywords, air dates, segment producer, segment title, and in some cases, transcripts and stills from the video. There are also six boxes of photographs and slides taken in the same regions, depicting destruction in areas of conflict, forced labor, refugees and refugee camps, and protests. The majority of the photographs, almost all color snapshots, were taken on the Burma/Thai border, in Bosnia and Hercegovina, and refugee camps in Rwanda. One set of seven folders are images taken by staff of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children (now known as the Women's Refugee Commission). There are other images that come from United Nations organizations, including the International Refugee Commission. Finally, organizational records from the offices of IMI comprise a significant amount of the materail in this collection, including an extensive database of the audiovisual components and transcripts from war crimes tribunals.</p>

               <p>Series contains groupings of images taken in areas of conflict around the world which form visual evidence gathered by the United Nations' Human Commission on Refugees (UNHCR).  Material includes color photos and slides showing fires burning or villages destroyed and injuries of Burmese refugees, taken in Burma or Thailand by human rights worker Kevin Heppner, founder of Karen Human Rights Group; photos and slides taken in Burma, or on the Thailand/Burma border in refugee camps acquired or made for IMI and gathered or taken by filmmaker, Jeanne Hallacy, who spent time in Bangkok; stills from Mikel Flamm, a professional photographer/journalist; photos and hi-8 video of the refugee camps on the Thailand/Burma border taken by members of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, including IMI founder Pippa Scott, when they visited the camps; and images of refugee camps and refugees chiefly in Rwanda and other countries in Africa, but also in Sri Lanka and Turkey.</p>
               
               <p>Other images contain scenes of mass demonstrations for peace, possibly in Thailand; forced labor in Thailand; ruined cities in Sarajevo and photos of residents and mass burial sites; elections and voting scenes, possibly from Burma or Thailand; burning oil fields in Kuwait; and other scenarios in countries such as China, Rwanda, Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Pakistan. Many of these photographs can be assumed to have been taken in secret and smuggled out of the country of origin.</p>
               
               <p>Photographs and slides, along with a few negatives, are arranged by country name, with unidentified images at the end of the sequence. Slides are indicated - the rest are photographs. Most are undated but can be estimated at being from the 1990s to 2000. Also included and filed as found with the images are small amounts of related materials such as newsletters, publicity, and correspondence. There are also a few oversize items at the end of the series.</p>

                  <p>This subseries contains material regarding human rights abuses in the Middle East, focusing primarily on Iran, Iraq, Jordon, Kuwait and their Kurdish populations. Material formats include overviews of the Middle East Archive, trip itineraries, interviews with political figures, news articles, and correspondence. The majority of correspondence deals with news and film distribution outlets, witness documentaries and collections of other visual material from both European and Gulf networks. Legal documents primarily include license agreements with organizations such as Amnesty International. Tape logs and synopses, tape annotations, and lists of tapes to purchase also comprise this subseries. Additional correspondence can be found under the subsection "People." Further audiovisual material on the Middle East can be found in the International Monitor Institute Middle East Archive records, also at the Rubenstein Library.</p>

                  <p>This subseries consists almost entirely of transcripts of the Radio-Télévision Libres des Milles Collines broadcasts inciting genocide, featuring prominently journalists Gaspard Gahie, Valerie Bemeriki, Kantano Kabimana, Anani Nkurunziza, and Georges Ruggiu. Other materials include Rwanda Tribunal commendation letters, interviews with victims and perpetrators, United Nations Security Council resolutions, archive database information, information on documentaries of the genocide, and scholarly material on radio as an instrument of genocide. Further correspondence can be found under the subsection "People." Further audiovisual material on Rwanda can be found in the International Monitor Institute Rwanda Archive records, also at the Rubenstein Library.</p>
