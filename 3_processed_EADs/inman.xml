         <p>Will Inman was a poet, essayist, editor, and
		  publisher. He was born William Archibald McGirt, Jr. in
		  Wilmington, North Carolina where his father, William A.
		  McGirt, was in the insurance and real estate business and
		  his mother, Delia E. McGirt (maiden name Inman), was a
		  registered nurse. He attended Duke University, graduating
		  with an A.B in 1943. After college, Inman worked as a union
		  organizer for tobacco workers in North Carolina before
		  moving to New York City in the late 1950s. He served as the
		  Vice-president of Free University of New York in the mid
		  1960s. He has worked as an editor and publisher of various
		  literary journals and has had his work published in
		  numerous anthologies and literary journals as well as in
		  individual volumes. His weekly column, <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Conchsound in the
		  Hills,</title> was published in the Franklin, PA
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">News-Herald </title>in the
		1960s. In addition to writing poetry, fiction, plays, and
		essays, Inman was also a prolific correspondent and
		diarist. He was active in numerous causes, including
		the War in Vietnam, the Civil Rights movement, gay rights,
		and various environmental issues. In 1956, he was
		questioned by the House Un-American Activities Committee as
		to his relationship with the Communist Party. His activism
		continued into the 1990s; he led writing workshops in
		an Arizona State Prison, as well as teaching writing to the
		homeless in transition.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The correspondence, diaries, manuscripts,
		  clippings, and printed material in the Will Inman Papers
		  span from 1939-1999, and serve to document the life and
		  literary career of the poet, essayist, editor, educator,
		  and publisher.</p>
         
         <p>Inman was a prolific corespondent and maintained
		  regular correspondent relationships with his friends and
		  family, as well as with his readers and other editors and
		  authors. He also regularly wrote to political and social
		  figures during the 1960s. These letters to public and
		  political figures express admiration and voice concerns
		  about political events and social conditions. Inman
		  protested in favor of civil rights, ending the war in
		  Vietnam, and various environmental causes, and his letters
		  reflect his thoughts and opinions on these subjects. Inman
		  was also in regular contact with the editors and publishers
		  of various literary magazines and the letters to these
		  individuals document his efforts to publish his work. The
		  collection holds many of Inman's out going correspondence
		  as he regularly kept copies of his own letters. </p>
         
         <p>Inman's copious diaries provide almost daily
		  detail of his life from 1950-1994. In his diaries Inman
		  recorded daily events, poetic inspirations, and his
		  responses to world events. The diaries also include
		  information about the poetry he is working on and several
		  include typescripts of completed poems.</p>
         
         <p>Inman also kept detailed records concerning his
		  completed writings. He kept typescript copies of his poems
		  and other writings, ordering them chronologically into
		  notebooks, and recording publication information onto the
		  typescripts. In organizing this collection, Inman's
		  notebooks were discarded, but the typescripts maintain the
		  order they held while bound in the notebooks, and serve to
		  provide a chronological overview of Inman's published and
		  unpublished writings.</p>
         
         <p>This collection also contains copies of several of
		  the anthologies and literary magazines where Inman
		  published his work and several of the poetic monographs
		  that Inman authored.</p>
         
         <p>Inman regularly published his early work in
		  newspapers in North Carolina. The collection contains
		  clippings of these early published works as well as
		  clippings of Inman's mid 1960's newspaper column
		  "Conchsounds in the Hills."</p>
         
         <p>There are also photographs of the McGirt family
		  from ca. 1910, chiefly mounted in albums, as well as
		  Inman's baby book from 1923. (16 accessions from 1998 and
		  1999) (35,475 items, 59 linear feet; dated 1910-1999)</p>
         
         <p>The addition (accession #2001-0195) (1676 items,
		  2.7 linear feet; dated 1940-2001, bulk 1976-2001) comprises
		  mainly personal correspondence to and from Inman and Jimmy
		  Santiago Baca, 1971-1995, including typescript poetry. It
		  also includes typescript poetry by Inman as Bill McGirt,
		  1940-1956; other poetry by Inman; professional
		  correspondence; and a journal kept by Inman, 2000-2001.
		  </p>
         
         <p>The addition (accession #2002-0143) (2250 items,
		  3.60 linear feet; dated 1982-2001) consists primarily of
		  incoming and outgoing personal correspondence. Topics
		  include Inman's poems, publication work, and his political
		  activites. There is also poetry and prose by Inman and
		  others, and 20 black-and-white and 148 color
		  photographs.</p>
         
         <p>The addition (accession# 2003-0124 and
		  2003-0181)(2775 items, 3.6 linear feet; dated 1957-2003,
		  bulk 1970-1989) contains published and unpublished
		  typescript poetry written by Will Inman. Also includes
		  literary newsletters, periodicals and brochures; a notebook
		  containing poetry, biographical information and
		  professional correspondence; and a paperweight.</p>
         
         <p>Addition (2009-0263) (500 items, 0.6 lin. ft.; dated 1976-2009) includes correspondence, poetry by Inman and others, press releases and reviews, official documents (such as his birth certificate, insurance information, and medical documents), and materials from Inman's death and funeral.</p>

				  several
				  prisons near

				  contain many examples of the writings that the

				  with the
				  prisoners. While this

				  it may not quote the names of individual
				  prisoners. This
				  correspondence has
				  been arranged chronologically to the year level, but may
