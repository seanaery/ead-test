         <p>After

		  creative director at JWT to rise to the level of Chairman, Board of Directors.
		  In the midst of a management crisis that hit the financially ailing company,
		  Metter resigned in 1987. Metter was rehired as Chairman in 1988; his primary
		  tasks were to coordinate new business efforts for JWT USA, provide additional
		  strategic advice for ongoing accounts, and focus on general management and
		  creative troubleshooting.</p>
         
         <p>During his time with JWT, Metter won numerous creative awards,
		  including Clios,
		  Cannes Film Festival awards, <emph render="italic">Advertising Age</emph> 100 Best TV Commercials, and others. He
		  published several articles about the advertising business in
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Advertising Age</title> and other industry

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Bertram Metter Papers span 1908 to 2000, with the bulk of the
		  collection dating 1953 through the late 1980s. The collection includes
		  materials in a variety of formats, including correspondence, writings,
		  newspaper and magazine clippings, sheet music, printed materials, photographs,
		  and photostats, that document Metter's thirty years in advertising and
		  marketing, with a focus on his career as a copywriter, creative director, and
		  Vice Chairman at J. Walter Thompson USA (JWT). The collection provides a record
		  of Metter's early work as a <emph render="doublequote">direct response
		  specialist</emph> for the Ford Motor Company direct marketing operation, and
		  other roles on the Ford account (Metter directed print and television promotion
		  for Ford and played a key role in the launching of several new car models). In
		  addition to Ford materials, the collection documents Metter's work for other
		  major clients, including the Pepsi-Cola Company (Mexico) and Liggett &amp;
		  Myers Tobacco Company. While the bulk of the collection consists of advertising
		  and marketing research, client reports and correspondence, promotional
		  materials, and other professional files, the collection also contains materials
		  related to Metter's later work as a consultant and author, including drafts of
		  an unpublished book manuscript entitled
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Breaking the Rules at J. Walter
		  Thompson,</title> a chronicle of his career at JWT. </p>
         
         <p>The collection is organized into four series: <emph render="bold">Professional Files</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Ford Motor Company Account Files</emph>, and
		  <emph render="bold">Other Clients</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Files Series</emph> contains JWT
		  office (non-client) files, memoranda, and publications; industry publications
		  and press clippings; overviews of Metter's professional biography; and limited
		  files on Metter's consulting work for
