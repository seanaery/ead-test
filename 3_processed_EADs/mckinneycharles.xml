                  <p>Contains drafts of general agency presentations and advertisements. Bulk of materials include McKinney's handwritten notes in which he experimented with agency slogans and general campaign concepts, particularly those which became the basis for the agency's <emph render="doublequote">flip chart</emph> presentations. Contains extensive materials related to the agency's <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Anatomy of Selling an Idea</title> campaign, which referenced the life and work of artist Leonardo da Vinci. Most of the items arrived as ruled note pads, with reference materials and additional drafts interleaved. Perforated pages from legal pads were detached. Legal sized items were photocopied and reduced to letter size. Original order of notebook pages and interleaved items was maintained. Items were grouped into folders according to the notepad to which they were attached. The presentation's title was used as the folder title; where no title was available, the presentation's first words were used as folder title. Notepads containing sketches for multiple or unidentifiable presentations were detached, paperclipped and foldered as <emph render="doublequote">miscellaneous flip chart drafts</emph> or <emph render="doublequote">miscellaneous presentation drafts.</emph> Folders arranged alphabetically.</p>
