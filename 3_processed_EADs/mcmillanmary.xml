         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The
		  Mary McMillan Papers,
		  1936-1997 and undated (bulk 1952-1991), consist chiefly of
		  journals and
		  printed material, but also
		  include
		  correspondence,
		  writings and speeches,
		  photographic material,
		  scrapbooks,
		  clippings,
		  videocassettes,
		  audio cassettes, and
		  memorabilia. Arranged in
		  nine series based primarily on the format of the material,
		  the papers illuminate the personal life and professional
		  work of McMillan, a United Methodist missionary and teacher
		  at the
		  Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College in

		  Hiroshima, Japan. In addition
		  to her work as a teacher, the collection documents
		  McMillan's service to the <emph render="italic">Kyodan</emph>, a unifying organization for
		  Christian missionaries in Japan, and to the
		  <emph render="italic">hibakusha</emph>, the survivors of
		  the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and
		  Nagasaki, as well as her peace
		  activism. Also included are materials related to the
		  Topaz Relocation Center, a
		  Japanese-American internment camp in
		  Utah where McMillan worked in
		  1943. The papers are mostly in English, but include some
		  Japanese language materials.</p>
         
         <p>The bulk of the collection consists of the
		  <emph render="bold">Journals Series</emph>, whose 43
		  journals contain almost daily accounts of McMillan's work
		  at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, her involvement with the
		  Ushita Christian Church, and
		  her encounters with friends and other people. Also included
		  are her personal thoughts about world events, particularly
		  those related to
		  peace and
		  nuclear disarmament. Beginning
		  on Aug. 11, 1939 with the final preparations for her
		  initial departure, McMillan records her activities through
		  her first year and a half in Japan. The 1939 and 1940
		  journals document in depth McMillan's adaptation to life in
		  Japan, including her training in the Japanese language and
		  customs, her first visits to various cities throughout the
		  country, and the difficulties she faced as an American
		  woman in pre-World War II Japan. After she and other
		  American workers in Hiroshima were forcibly evacuated on
		  Feb. 29, 1941, journal entries are scarce; however, the
		  almost-daily entries resume in 1952 and continue until the
		  day of McMillan's death on July 19, 1991.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to the journals, McMillan's
		  professional work as a United Methodist missionary and
		  teacher at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College is well documented
		  through the <emph render="bold">Correspondence
		  Series</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches
		  Series</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Printed Material
		  Series</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Biographical
		  Material Series</emph> includes McMillan's handwritten
		  autobiographical notes, as well as newspaper and magazine
		  clippings and booklets documenting McMillan's work at
		  Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College,
		  and with the
		  Ushita Christian Church, which
		  McMillan helped found in 1948. McMillan's correspondence
		  also sheds light on her work through "mission letters,"
		  mass mailings which she wrote periodically as a way of
		  updating her supporters in the United States on her work in
		  Hiroshima.</p>
         
         <p>McMillan also was a staunch advocate of world
		  peace and nuclear disarmament, and after her retirement
		  from the
		  United Methodist Church in
		  1980, she spent much of her time writing letters and
		  speaking in churches throughout the United States promoting
		  her cause. McMillan's role as a pacifist is well well
		  documented throughout the entire collection by her
		  correspondence, photographs of demonstrations and marches,
		  printed materials, and items in the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>. Much of the material
		  in the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches
		  Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold"> Printed Material
		  Series</emph> is related to
		  peace activism, and covers
		  topics such as the lingering effects of the atomic bomb
		  attack on Hiroshima and that city's fight for peace, the
		  first-hand accounts of bomb survivors, and the United
		  Methodist Church's pacifist stance.</p>
         
         <p>Also contributing to an understanding of
		  McMillan's life, the <emph render="bold">Photographic
		  Material Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Memorabilia Series</emph> offer visual and
		  three-dimensional documentation of her activities as a
		  missionary, teacher, and friend to the Japanese. </p>

               <p>Contains 43 journals maintained by McMillan
				during her time in
				Hiroshima and her
				retirement, documenting in great detail her daily life and
				work as well as her travels throughout
				East Asia. She also noted
				her thoughts and concerns about world events and her
				peace activism. Many entries
				describe visits by her students and friends in Japan and
				provide a revealing look at
				Japanese social life and
				  customs. The journals are arranged
				chronologically. Many small groups of loose materials were
				found laid into the beginning or end of the journals; these
				were removed and placed in a separate folder following the
				journal; some of these items appear to be unrelated to the
				journals in which they were found.</p>

               <p>Personal and professional correspondence of
				Mary McMillan, divided into outgoing and incoming subseries
				and arranged in chronological order. The
				<emph render="bold">Outgoing Correspondence</emph>
				primarily contains letters sent by McMillan to churches or
				individuals in the United States who had supported her work
				in Japan. These "mission letters" describe McMillan's work
				at
				Hiroshima Jo Gakuin
				  College and
				Ushita Christian Church as
				well as her beliefs in
				world peace and
				disarmament. Some of the
				<emph render="bold">Incoming Correspondence</emph>,
				particularly in the early 1980s, is in Japanese. The
				majority of the letters are to McMillan from friends,
				missionaries, and former students in Japan after her
				retirement in 1980. Also included in a small third
				subseries is other correspondence that was neither to nor
				from McMillan. Many of these letters were written to Jane
				Greenwood, McMillan's sister, from individuals and
				organizations expressing their condolences over McMillan's
				death. A few pieces of correspondence have photographs
				clipped to them.</p>

				for slides; the material is further organized by subject
				matter. There are images of the
				Topaz Relocation Center in

				Utah, 
                  Hiroshima Jo Gakuin
				  College, McMillan's friends, former students and
				their families. Other images document her travels
				throughout East Asia, including trips to
				China and
				Taiwan. The bulk of the
				material consists of black-and-white and color casual
				snapshots of McMillan, her Japanese friends, and her former
				students with their families. These photographs document
				Japanese wedding traditions and other
				ceremonies as well as
				various marches and activities promoting
				peace and
				nuclear disarmament. There
				are ten images taken at the Topaz Japanese internment camp;
				most of the photographs were labeled with names and
				sometimes dates. The slides are in color and consist
				chiefly of images from McMillan's travels. All materials
				are arranged in chronological order</p>

				Vietnam War, the growth of
				the United States' Star Wars defense system, and the
				conflict in the
				Middle East.</p>
