            <p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Archives
			 arrived at Duke in various accessions from both OAAA and from Fairleigh
			 Dickinson University, where a portion of the archives was originally housed. An
			 initial container list was created by Technical Services staff, covering the
			 largest accession. The over 200 boxes were not internally well-organized, with
			 files that fell within the same subject area scattered across a number of
			 boxes. The initial container list was used to pre-organize the boxes for
			 intellectual arrangement, according to subject areas. These subject areas are
			 reflected in the series names listed below, which were created at Duke in order
			 to group related materials together.</p>
            
            <p>The contents of folders were for the most part kept intact and were
			 tranferred to acid free folders within acid-free boxes. The information that
			 was included in the initial container list was kept with the original folder.
			 That information is included in the container list and is demarcated by
			 brackets. Some inconsistency between the information in brackets and the
			 contents of the folder may exist since it is possible that some items were
			 removed from the folder if they belonged in a more appropriate place.</p>
            
            <p>The series are organized alphabetically, with the
			 <emph render="bold">Oversize Series</emph> listed at the end. In general,
			 material within each series is further separated into smaller subseries
			 headings, and organized alphabetically. However, where materials reflected
			 events that occurred with periodic regularity (such as meeting minutes) or
			 reflected a progressive development over time (such as legislative or legal
			 issues), a chronological ordering was used for better context.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, within each series the information on one topic may be
			 divided between letter- and legal-size groupings, and each box number also
			 indicates the box size. Oversize items from each series have been removed,
			 placed in and listed in the <emph render="bold">Oversize Series</emph>. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Association of America
		  (OAAA) Archives</emph> document the operations and activities of the OAAA, the
		  primary professional organization throughout the modern history of the outdoor
		  advertising industry in the U.S.,
		  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="inclusive">1885-1990s</unitdate>. The bulk of material falls between 1941
		  and 1980, that is between the entry of the United States into World War II and
		  the end of the 1970s, a period that witnessed rapid and radical changes in the
		  ways that Americans viewed and used the outdoors. The collection also includes
		  materials pertaining to the OAAA's predecessor organizations such as the
		  Poster Advertising Association,
		  Associated Bill Posters, the
		  Painted Outdoor Advertising Association, and the
		  International Bill Poster's Association of North
			 America. Some of the major outdoor advertising companies and
		  organizations represented in this collection include:
		  General Outdoor;
		  Foster &amp; Kleiser;
		  United Advertising;
		  Institute of Outdoor Advertising (IOA);
		  National Outdoor Advertising Bureau (NOAB); and
		  Outdoor Advertising, Inc. (OAI). There is some
		  information on the outdoor industry abroad as well, especially Canada and the
		  England/U.K. Taken as a whole, the collection reflects the activities and
		  concerns (as well as the record-keeping practices) of the outdoor advertising
		  industry.</p>
         
         <p>Although physically organized into 23 series in alphabetical order,
		  the collection may also be collocated intellectually into five main themes or
		  topical areas: organization, affiliations, operational activities, technical
		  activities, and audio-visual material. These broad categories reflect the scope
		  of activities undertaken by the OAAA, the network of trade associations,
		  professional organizations, governmental regulatory bodies, material
		  manufacturers and engineering societies, and member associates. There is
		  considerable overlap among the subjects covered by the various series, so
		  searches of multiple series (and/or keyword electronic searches) should be
		  undertaken to obtain a comprehensive view of the collection.</p>
         
         <p>Included in the collection are multiple-format materials: paper files,
		  printed materials, photographs, slides, blueprints, placards and metal signage.
		  Other materials are a wide variety of media and formats, such as
		  correspondence, directories, published materials (such as technical and
		  periodic reports, newsletters and bylaws), membership records, texts of
		  speeches, articles and clippings, minutes of association meetings, and industry
		  publications such as the long-running serial
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Poster</title>. The numerous
		photographs scattered in files have been given index numbers and have been
		replaced in the files by photocopies so the originals may be better preserved
		and more accessible for browsing. The original images are located in the
		<emph render="bold">Photographs and Negatives Series</emph>, and are organized
		by index numbers. A searchable online database, <emph render="bold">Resource of
		Outdoor Advertising Descriptions (ROAD)</emph>, contains descriptions of these
		images.</p>
         
         <p>Researchers interested in the organization of the OAAA might begin
		  with the following series: <emph render="bold">Administration--Officers</emph>;
		  <emph render="bold">Budget / Finance</emph>; <emph render="bold">Constitution
		  &amp; Bylaws</emph>; <emph render="bold">History</emph>; <emph render="bold">Meetings</emph>; <emph render="bold">Organization--Committees</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Organization--Departments and Divisions</emph>. These series
		  document the overall organizational structure and operations of the OAAA, its
		  board, committees and departments, as well as the record of its activities as
		  reflected in meeting minutes, budgets, and its governing bylaws and policies.
		  The OAAA was organized as a corporation, with a president and key officers
		  elected from the Association membership. A Chairman's Advisory Committee
		  assisted the Association leadership. Prominent officers represented in the
		  collection include
		  Frank Cawl,
		  Karl Ghaster, and
		  Walter Holan. Below that, the OAAA followed a dual
		  <emph render="doublequote">line and staff</emph> organizational structure in
		  which functions and activities determined the range of departmental divisions,
		  and each division was overseen by an administrative committee which carried the
		  same name as the division or department. Key divisions within the Association
		  include the Public Policy, Research and Engineering, Business Development, and
		  Plant Development divisions.</p>
         
         <p>Material pertaining to the industry affiliations of the outdoor
		  advertising industry is contained in the following series: <emph render="bold">History</emph>, <emph render="bold">International</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Membership</emph>, <emph render="bold">Notre Dame</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising Companies</emph>, <emph render="bold">Publications</emph>, <emph render="bold">State
		  Associations</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Trade Organizations</emph>. This
		  theme includes the regional and state outdoor advertising associations, along
		  with the outdoor advertising companies that comprised the membership of the
		  OAAA. Prominent among these are the
		  General Outdoor Advertising Co.,
		  Foster &amp; Kleiser Company, the
		  R.C. Maxwell Company,
		  John Donnelly and Sons, the
		  Thomas Cusack Company,
		  Columbus Outdoor, and
		  United Advertising. In addition, the collection
		  documents the activities of a number of professional organizations linked to
		  outdoor advertising, such as the
		  Association of National Advertisers, the
		  Associated Advertising Clubs of America, the
		  Advertising Federation of America, the
		  American Association of Advertising Agencies, the
		  American Advertising Federation, the
		  National Outdoor Advertising Bureau,
		  Outdoor Advertising, Inc., the
		  Institute of Outdoor Advertising, the
		  International Congress of Outdoor Advertising, and

		  Notre Dame University's School of Outdoor
			 Advertising.</p>
         
         <p>The operational activities of the outdoor industry are documented
		  mainly in the following series: <emph render="bold">Campaign Case
		  Studies</emph>, <emph render="bold">Issues and Activities</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">Local Markets</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Regulation</emph>. These activities included sales, industry
		  promotion and education, the monitoring of legislation and public policy
		  affecting outdoor advertising, and public service campaigns. Operational
		  activities linked the OAAA and outdoor advertising to the larger world, through
		  such programs as patriotic and public service campaigns, as well as advocacy
		  and promotional efforts through trade and general-audience publications. In
		  addition, these files document the OAAA’s participation in the public debate
		  over issues directly concerning outdoor advertising, such as zoning ordinances,
		  advertising regulation, and visual aesthetics. There are files on research
		  firms and researchers such as
		  A.C. Nielsen,
		  Bruskin Associates,
		  General Media,
		  John Paver and
		  Wilbur Smith. These series show the interactions
		  between the OAAA and both governmental and non-governmental agencies and
		  interest groups, such as the
		  American Automobile Association, the
		  National Safety Council, the
		  Advertising Council (and its precursor the
		  War Advertising Council), and the
		  General Federation of Women's Clubs, as well as
		  some notable individual activists such as
		  Elizabeth Lawton. The materials in these files
		  show the relationships, sometimes oppositional but frequently collaborative,
		  between these agencies and the OAAA, over topics that included legislation and
		  litigation over the regulation of outdoor advertising (at state and local as
		  well as at the federal level) displays (posters, signs, and billboards),
		  patriotism (especially during World War II), the energy crisis, urban renewal,
		  zoning ordinances, the Highway Beautification Act (pursuant to the Federal
		  Highway Acts), and highway and traffic safety. Also included in the series in
		  this topical area are case studies of a wide range of outdoor advertising
		  campaigns, involving such client companies as the
		  Kellogg Company,
		  Ford Motor Company, the
		  Morton Salt Company,
		  Swift and Co., and the
		  Clark Candy Company (now owned by
		  New England Confectionery Company). In addition,
		  the OAAA and its membership conducted advertising campaigns designed to
		  demonstrate the effectiveness of the outdoor medium, using famous figures such
		  as
		  Calvin Coolidge,
		  Woodrow Wilson,
		  Miss America Shirley Cothran, and even with a
		  fictitious automobile, the <emph render="doublequote">Testa</emph> car.</p>
         
         <p>Technologies and research-related activities involved in outdoor
		  advertising are represented in the series: <emph render="bold">Audience /
		  Readership</emph>; <emph render="bold">Physical Structure</emph>;
		  <emph render="bold">Research</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Traffic Audit
		  Bureau</emph>. These series address those activities that comprise the
		  production and display of outdoor advertising, such as billboard structure
		  standards; research on paint, paper and glue; illumination; sign legibility;
		  layout and typography; and posting practices. These files include materials on
		  advertising reception and recall, traffic counts and other market-related
		  research. Research aimed at improving the efficiency of outdoor advertising
		  includes studies of billboard and poster placement, standardized sizes of
		  billboards and posters, legibility studies, the development of market research
		  methodologies, and the audits of individual poster plants to ensure
		  industry-wide standard practices. In addition, the OAAA engaged in ongoing
		  research into the technical aspects of manufacturing and posting outdoor
		  advertising displays, through studies of billboard structure construction and
		  engineering, building and plant maintenance, landscaping, paint and color
		  research, paper, glue, illumination techniques and standards, the formation and
		  modification of building codes and code compliance, and workplace safety. These
		  activities involved ongoing relationships between the OAAA and a number of
		  research and engineering agencies and associations, such as the
		  A.C. Nielsen Company (readership studies), the
		  Simmons Market Research Bureau,
		  Wilbur Smith and Associates, the
		  Barney Link Fellowship (academic research), the
		  Traffic Audit Bureau (a nationwide organization
		  based in N.Y.),
		  Raymond Loewy Associates (developer of the Loewy
		  panels), the
		  Tiffen Art Metal Co. (all-metal billboard
		  structures),
		  Bruskin Associates (foot-traffic research),
		  Daniel Starch and Staff, and
		  Axiom (market research).</p>
         
         <p>The audio-visual files, which include the <emph render="bold">Publications Series</emph>; the <emph render="bold">Video, Film
		  and Audio Recordings Series</emph>; and the <emph render="bold">Photographs and
		  Negatives Series</emph>, contain materials such as photographs, slides,
		  negatives, trade and Association publications, training films, and audio
		  recordings of presentations. A searchable on-line database (<emph render="bold">Resource of Outdoor Advertising Descriptions --ROAD</emph>)
		  contains descriptions of the majority of these photographs, slides and
		  negatives. Please contact a reference archivist for information on accessing
		  the ROAD resource. Photographs, negatives, and slides are available for
		  research usage. Films, videotapes and audio recordings are closed for
		  preservation reasons.</p>

            <emph render="bold">24-Sheet Poster</emph>: The most widely used
		  poster size in North America, and what most people mean when they refer to
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">
               
               <emph render="bold">billboards</emph>.</title> These posters have a copy area

            <emph render="bold">Animation</emph>: Devices or techniques used to
		  create the illusion of movement in a poster or bulletin display. Animation may
		  be mechanical, like a moving armature or figure, or it may be achieved with
		  lighting patterns. The famous Coca-Cola spectacular at Times Square, for
		  example, uses programmed lights to create the illusion that the Coke bottle
		  regularly fills and empties.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Approach</emph>: In a line of travel, the distance
		  from which an advertising structure first becomes fully visible to the point
		  where the copy is no longer readable (having passed out of sight). Sometimes
		  descriptive terms are used, such as Flash Approach, Short Approach, Medium

		  advertising structure remains visible to a potential reader in traffic.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Flash Approach</emph>: For pedestrian traffic, it
		  refers to an approach distance of under 40'; for vehicles an approach of under
		  75' (for vehicles moving under 30 miles per hour) to under 100' (for vehicles
		  moving over 30 mph).</p>

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC)</emph>: An
		  independent auditing organization that conducts advertising and readership
		  research, primarily in newspapers and magazines. It was founded in 1914, and
		  continues its research mission today. The pre-eminent print media research
		  organization in the world, it served as the model for the <emph render="bold">Traffic Audit Bureau</emph>. In fact, TAB was conceived to
		  provide the same kinds of service to the outdoor advertising industry that ABC
		  provided for the print industry.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Audited Circulation</emph>: The
		  <emph render="bold">Traffic Audit Bureau (TAB)</emph> investigates and
		  determines the <emph render="bold">circulation</emph> for a given advertising
		  location, based on procedures generally accepted by the business community. The
		  <emph render="bold">Audit Bureau of Circulations</emph> is another independent
		  reporting firm that provides similar research services.</p>

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Billboard</emph>: A generic term that refers to
		  any large outdoor advertising sign. These may be any of the many multiple-sheet
		  posters, <emph render="bold">painted bulletins</emph>, wall murals, stadium
		  signs, and so on. However, in popular use, the term billboard refers to the
		  standard <emph render="bold">24-sheet poster</emph>, along with its physical
		  structure, which became a ubiquitous part of the American roadside
		  architecture. The outdoor industry dropped "billboard" as a technical term in
		  the early 1930s, due to negative connotations, but the word has persisted in
		  the popular vocabulary of the American public to this day.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Blanked ad</emph>: In a recall or awareness study,
		  portions of a poster's <emph render="bold">copy</emph>, usually the
		  advertiser's name, brand name, or marketing slogan, are covered and hidden from
		  view. Respondents are asked if they can identify the ad despite the missing or
		  covered copy elements.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Blanking</emph>: The white paper border

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Bleed Area</emph>: Bleed is when printed images
		  run all the way to the edge of the page, as opposed to standard printing which
		  leaves a white border around the image. Bleeds are usually printed larger than
		  the finished image (called trim size). The part of the printed image's margin
		  that is trimmed away to achieve a final size is called the bleed area. It
		  differs from cropping, in which a part of the actual image is removed.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Bleed-Through</emph>: A situation where previous
		  advertising <emph render="bold">copy</emph> can be seen though present copy.
		  Also called <emph render="doublequote">show-through.</emph>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Blister</emph>: Air pockets that sometimes form
		  between the sheets of a poster and the posting surface.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Circulation</emph>: The traffic volume at a given
		  location; it is synonymous with <emph render="bold">traffic</emph>. Circulation
		  refers to the circulation of people in an urban landscape. Beginning in 1912,
		  the outdoor advertising industry became increasingly concerned with the growing
		  urban concentration of people, the patterns of circulation of people, and the
		  challenge of locating advertising structures at points of maximum circulation.

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Cooperative Account</emph>: An outdoor advertising

            <emph render="bold">Daily Effective Circulation (DEC)</emph>: The size
		  of the audience that has the opportunity to see a given advertising message in
		  a 24-hour period. It is the least number of people counted in the

		  opportunity to see an advertising display. The basic formula is: 50% of
		  pedestrian DGC traffic; 50% of motor vehicle traffic; and 25% of mass
		  transportation traffic.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Daily Gross Circulation (DGC)</emph>: The total

            <emph render="bold">District Showing</emph>: A showing where posters
		  are displayed in only a portion of a market (hence the term
		  <emph render="doublequote">district</emph>), rather than in the whole

            <emph render="bold">Gross Rating Points (GRP)</emph>: The total number
		  of <emph render="bold">impressions</emph> delivered by a <emph render="bold">showing</emph>. GRP are figured by dividing the

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Hoarding</emph>: An early word for
		  <emph render="bold">billboard</emph>. Originally, a hoarding, from the Old
		  French word for "fence," referred to the fencing placed around construction
		  sites. Its association with advertising came from the fact that such fences
		  were handy posting surfaces for bill posters. Eventually fences, along with
		  large wall-like structures, were erected specifically for advertising purposes
		  along roadways. Modern billboards represent the culmination of historical
		  efforts to control the placement of outdoor advertising as well as to regulate
		  the size and configuration of posting surfaces, in an effort to address
		  concerns and complaints raised by hoardings and the specter of "billboard
		  blight."</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Identification</emph>: Identification occurs when

            <emph render="bold">Intensity</emph>: The size of a poster
		  <emph render="bold">showing</emph>, or the extent to which an advertiser's

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Junior Poster</emph>: Junior posters are smaller
		  versions of standard <emph render="bold">24-sheet poster</emph> billboards that
		  maintained the billboard's 1:2.25 height-width proportions but included only
		  1/4 the overall dimensions and surface area. They were commonly referred to as
		  <emph render="bold">6-sheet posters</emph>, although the standard officially
		  adopted by the OAAA was technically a 6-1/2 sheet size. By the 1970s the term
		  <emph render="doublequote">Junior Poster</emph> was interchangable with the
		  term <emph render="bold">8-sheet poster</emph>. They were originally conceived
		  to reinforce and supplement standard-sized poster campaigns, but developed a
		  niche in urban areas, around retail establishments, and in sites where zoning
		  laws limited the use of larger posting structures.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Length of Approach</emph>: The measured distance

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Market</emph>: A market is generally considered in
		  terms of a local consumer area, typically a town or municipality. Traffic
		  research has shown that typically 20 percent of a town's roads carry 80 percent
		  of its traffic, within each market. Therefore, roughly equal sections of major
		  traffic arteries are divided into <emph render="bold">poster zones</emph>,
		  which determine the intensity of a poster display campaign, called a poster
		  <emph render="bold">showing</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Minimum Showing</emph>: The smallest number of

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">M.O.V.I.</emph>: Metro Outdoor Visibility Index. A
		  pre-testing technique that allows an advertiser to evaluate the effectiveness
		  of an outdoor message design by simulating the environment in which the message
		  will appear.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Net Advertising Circulation (NAC)</emph>: The
		  <emph render="bold">Daily Effective Circulation (DEC)</emph> of a showing,
		  modified by the poster structures' <emph render="bold">Space Position Value
		  (SPV)</emph>. To arrive at the NAC of a showing, the average NAC of all
		  illuminated panels in a <emph render="bold">poster plant</emph> is multiplied
		  by the number of illuminated panels in a showing. The same procedure is
		  followed for the un-illuminated panels in a showing, and the NAC is the sum of
		  the two figures.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Off-Premise Sign</emph>: A sign that advertises a

         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Outdoor Advertising</emph>: Refers to all
		  advertising encountered out-of-doors. The OAAA currently recognizes four broad
		  categories of outdoor advertising: <emph render="bold">billboards</emph>,
		  <emph render="bold">street furniture</emph>, and <emph render="bold">transit
		  advertising</emph> as well as alternative media, which includes advertising
		  sites such as stadiums, airborne advertising, and gas pumps.</p>

		  to all forms of advertising that reach consumers primarily outside his or her
		  home.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Painted Bulletin</emph>: Bulletins differ from
		  posters in a number of ways. Bulletin structures tend to be larger than poster
		  boards; the standard bulletin structure measures 14' x 48', or twice the width
		  of a standard poster panel. Also, bulletins generally occupy the most desirable
		  locations along major roadways. While <emph render="bold">poster panels</emph>
		  or sheets are typically mechanically reproduced by lithograph or other means,
		  painted bulletins are painted, frequently by hand, and each bulletin tends to
		  be in some way unique. Painted bulletins share a common history with the arts
		  of sign-painting, lettering and calligraphy. The term
		  <emph render="doublequote">painted bulletin</emph> also refers to notices and
		  advertisements painted on walls and roofs, as well as signs and notices painted
		  on barns along rural roadways. Painted bulletins frequently feature special
		  <emph render="bold">cutouts</emph> that alter the appearance of the structure.
		  They tend to be more expensive than posters, due not only to the desirability
		  of their locations but also to the labor required in their execution and
		  maintenance. Painted bulletins are generally leased for <emph render="bold">showings</emph> that last a year. </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Porta-Panel</emph>: Full-sized poster panels

            <emph render="bold">Poster Panel</emph>: A structure used to display
		  either <emph render="bold">24- or 30-sheet posters</emph>. It measures 12' high
		  by 24' wide. Also called a <emph render="bold">billboard</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Poster Plant</emph>: A poster plant consists of
		  all the bulletin structures in a single urban area controlled by a single
		  advertising company. The establishment of poster plant standardized operations,
		  construction, maintenance and quality control has been an integral part of the
		  OAAA's activities since its inception. The ultimate goal is for all poster
		  plants to deliver the same quality of service to advertisers, limiting the
		  difference only to the quality of the location of a plant's advertising
		  structures. </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Posting Date</emph>: The date on which the posters
		  of a <emph render="bold">showing</emph> are scheduled for display.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Pounce Pattern</emph>: A poster pattern is
		  projected onto large sheets of paper and traced in outline form. The outline is
		  then perforated with a needle, and the perforated designs are known as a pounce
		  pattern. Dust is blown through the perforations, which creates a pattern on the
		  posting <emph render="bold">face</emph>, ready for painting. Prior to
		  computerized graphic design techniques, it was a common practice for
		  transferring and enlarging <emph render="bold">copy</emph> art.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Premiere Panel</emph>: A standard display,
		  measuring 12'3" x 24'6" overall. Typically, premiere panels are single sheet
		  vinyl panels stretched over a 30-sheet poster panel structure.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Rain Lap</emph>: The practice of lapping
		  <emph render="bold">poster panel</emph> sections, so that the upper sections
		  overlap the lower sections, similar to shingles. Rain lap panels reduce
		  <emph render="bold">flagging</emph> and rain seepage.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Rates</emph>: Beginning in 1901 Associated Bill
		  Posters inaugurated the practice of publishing the rates of its member agencies
		  in an effort to promote a standard of service across the outdoor advertising
		  profession. The rates were listed in terms of the cost per sheet, a number
		  which had to be multiplied by the number of sheets required for each
		  <emph render="bold">poster</emph>, and by the number of postings in a
		  <emph render="bold">showing</emph>. Thus, a listed rate of 12 cents (.12) meant
		  that for example in Minneapolis, where a properly representative showing
		  required 80 24-sheet or 150 8-sheet posters, the typical cost (in 1900) of a
		  showing would be $144.00 for an 8-sheet display (150 x 8 x .12), or $230.40 for
		  a 24-sheet display (80 x 24 x .12). </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Reach</emph>: The approximate percentage of a
		  target audience population that will be potentially exposed to an advertising
		  message at least once during a <emph render="bold">showing</emph> period.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Readership-Remembrance</emph>: The number and
		  percentage of people who remember having seen a given poster.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Riding a Showing</emph>: A physical field
		  inspection of the panels used in a <emph render="bold">showing</emph>.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Roadside Signs</emph>: A collective term for all
		  signage found along roadsides. Roadside signage falls into 2 basic categories:
		  commercial (both on-premise and off-premise) and governmental (right-of-way
		  signage, including traffic markers, warning signs, and historic markers).</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Rotary Bulletin</emph>: A standard 14' x 48'
		  bulletin structure that can be moved (<emph render="doublequote">rotated</emph>) to different locations at fixed intervals.
		  </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Setback</emph>: The distance from the
		  <emph render="bold">line of travel</emph> to the center of an advertising
		  structure.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Showing</emph>: A <emph render="doublequote">package</emph> of poster displays. A showing generally
		  lasts for 30 days, and is categorized numerically in terms of
		  <emph render="bold">intensity</emph>, and generally noted as either
		  <emph render="italic">#50</emph> or <emph render="italic">#100</emph> showings.
		  A <emph render="italic">#50 showing</emph> includes one poster display for
		  every <emph render="bold">poster zone</emph> (a section of a local
		  <emph render="bold">market</emph>), a <emph render="italic">#100 showing</emph>
		  includes 2 posters, and so on. The numerical index ensures that each poster
		  campaign will receive an adequate distribution, and each advertiser will
		  receive equal treatment by the posting firm. Traditionally, showings were
		  referred to in terms of a full- (#100), half- (#50), or quarter- (#25) showing,
		  but by the 1920s, the terms had changed to: intensive, representative, and
		  minimum.</p>

		  factors: length of <emph render="bold">approach</emph>, speed of travel, angle
		  of the panel to approach, and the relationship of the panel to adjacent
		  panels.</p>

				  America</emph>. Edward A. Stahlbrodt of Rochester, N.Y. was elected as the
				  Association's first president. The following year ABPA would be incorporated.

				  handbills. It was the earliest recorded censorship exercised by an advertising
				  medium over copy in the U.S., and marked the beginning of a long practice of
				  self-regulation in the outdoor industry.</event>

				  vote per member, as opposed to one vote per town. The national Association's
				  primary task was to coordinate the activities of the several state
				  associations, and to undertake activities in the national arena that would not
				  be economical or practical for state associations. In addition, the national
				  Association itself was reorganized into seven divisions: Business Development
				  (sales promotion); Education (public relations); Legal (government
				  legislation); Plant Development (surveys and research); Membership and
				  Statistical (records); Finance and Budget (accounting); and a general

				Karl Ghaster, and
				Walter Holan. These latter files contain
				personal correspondence, notes from committee meetings and planning sessions,
				as well as texts for speeches and presentations; they are of special interest
				to researchers interested in the wide range of activities undertaken by OAAA
				executives in the course of daily operations, and they provide a glimpse into
				the corporate culture of the OAAA at different times.</p>

               <p>The series highlights one of the key areas of concern to the
				outdoor advertising industry, that of ensuring that their efforts to advertise
				actually reached potential consumers. Included here are numerous studies on a
				wide range of products and campaigns, for such varied products as
				 Kellogg's, 
                   Ford, 
                   Morton Salt, and
				 Swift meats. These studies focused on
				audience reception of outdoor advertising campaigns, testing variables such as
				reach and frequency, copy identification, recall and remembrance of advertising
				messages. While most of these studies used actual campaigns, some test
				campaigns were developed specifically for research use, like Calvin Coolidge
				(Hooper), Woodrow Wilson
				(Turner Advertising) and the fictional
				<emph render="doublequote">Testa</emph> automobile
				(OAI). In addition to the studies and research
				reports, the series also includes reports on market segmentation (like the
				youth market) and analyses of research methodologies. These materials are
				important to the understanding of how the outdoor industry perceived the
				marketplace during a period of rapid change within American consumer
				culture.</p>

				within the outdoor advertising industry. While the series does feature a wide
				range of materials relating to accounting, the account records themselves are
				not continuous over long periods of time. As such, the materials collected here
				are of research interest perhaps more for the types of accounting records
				maintained at various times than for the actual accounting data retained.</p>

               <p>The series collects materials relating to the historical
				development of outdoor advertising, as well as the treatment of outdoor
				advertising as history, through its incorporation into various archives. Much
				of the material collected here was identified as being of historical interest
				by OAAA officials over time, including speeches, articles, clippings, photos
				and publications of the predecessors to the OAAA (such as the
				Associated Bill Posters and Distributors, and
				the
				Poster Advertising Association). Other items
				that trace the roots of organized outdoor advertising, providing it with a
				sense of history and historical importance, are also included.</p>
               
               <p>[NOTE: Some large materials have been removed to the Oversize
				Materials Series. A Listing may be found at the end of this container
				list.]</p>
               
               <p>Arranged alphabetically by topic. Letter size folders are followed
				by legal size folders in two runs.</p>

				global reach of outdoor advertising than an in-depth understanding. Canada and
				England are the most heavily represented countries in this series, but there
				are also limited materials on the outdoor industry elsewhere in the world.</p>

               <p>The series covers a range of activities that involved the OAAA and
				the outdoor industry. The main topics include building maintenance, press,
				public service, sales and World War II-era wartime activities. Significant
				files include those concerning the energy crisis of the 1970s, showing how the
				U.S. government mandates to reduce energy consumption impacted the outdoor
				industry in a variety of ways, from restrictions on illuminated signage to
				gasoline rationing and speed limit reductions. Other important sections in this
				series include files on association reorganization plans, the relationship
				between the outdoor industry and public service associations, outdoor sales
				promotion, and support of World War II.</p>

               <p>The series contains different types of outdoor advertising
				research studies that focus on specific areas, towns, regions, or communities,
				or demographic groups. The local focus was a distinctive feature of the outdoor
				industry, which until the late twentieth century was structured by an extensive
				network of relatively small firms that served a specific regional market. These
				studies are significant not only because they represent the local aspect of the
				outdoor industry's culture, but also because they connect research
				methodologies and specific advertising campaigns to real markets and sites.</p>

				the International Congress of Outdoor Advertising and the meetings of the
				Institute of Outdoor Advertising are also represented in this series. The
				conference proceedings capture some of the culture and ongoing work of the

				experiences and pressing concerns of the association membership.</p>

               <p>The series documents the long relationship between the OAAA and
				the University of Notre Dame. Beginning in the early 1940s, the outdoor
				industry sought to establish a school to train young professionals for careers
				in outdoor advertising. Notre Dame was the site for the first outdoor
				advertising educational program and the first university to offer a degree in
				outdoor advertising. The series includes correspondence between OAAA and Notre
				Dame leading to the establishment of the School of Outdoor Advertising, as well
				as contribution rolls, program information, and research reports produced at
				Notre Dame for the outdoor industry.</p>

               <p>The series contains the files and records of the committees that
				formed within the OAAA staff organizational structure. Some of the committees
				were short-lived and created for a specific purpose (like the Home Ownership
				Committee), while others were fundamental to the operation of the OAAA and
				survived for decades (such as the Chairman's Advisory Committee). The series
				provides an overview of the organizational structure of OAAA management and
				staff operations. In general, the committees provided oversight for and set the
				basic policies for the departments and divisions. Researchers interested in the

				  organizational structure, and proposed ways to streamline the organizational

				  the Chairman's Advisory Committee as a standing committee with executive
				  authority, and was the originator of the proposal to merge OAAA with OAI (which
				  finally took place in the 1970s).</p>

               <p>The series contains the files and records of the departments and
				divisions that made up the OAAA's operational structure. The series provides an
				overview of the organizational structure of OAAA line operations; the
				department names reflect the primary concerns of the association: business
				development, plant operations, education, painted displays, poster plant
				development, public policy, and research and engineering. As with most firms
				organized by line and staff, the departments carried out the policies
				identified and articulated by the committees. Researchers interested in the
				operational aspects of the OAAA should consult both the files relating to a
				particular committee as well as those that pertain to related departments.</p>

				size folders are followed by legal size folders in two runs.</p>

               <p>The series includes files on over 90 outdoor advertising
				companies. Most of the files are fairly brief and consist of only a promotional
				pamphlet, a news clipping or a TAB plant audit; other files are more extensive.
				Major firms, such as
				Columbus Outdoor, 
                  Thomas Cusack Co.,
				John Donnelly &amp; Sons,
				Foster &amp; Kleiser,
				General Outdoor, and
				United Advertising are more heavily
				represented. The series also gives an overview into the scale of the outdoor
				industry in the U.S. during the second half of the 20th century.</p>
               
               <p>See also the Traffic Audit Bureau Series for other TAB
				materials.</p>
               
               <p>Arranged alphabetically by company name. Letter size folders are

               <p>The main categories in this series are federal and state
				legislation, federal and state litigation, interest groups, and research
				relating to billboard regulation. The bulk of the material collected here
				concerns the legislation surrounding the creation of the Federal Interstate
				Highway System, notably the Federal Highway acts and Highway Beautification
				acts of the 1950s-1970s. There are files on various interest groups, such as
				the American Automobile Association and the General Federation of Women's
				Clubs, as well as the outdoor industry's own efforts to propose model billboard
				laws and plans for self-regulation.</p>
               
               <p>Overall, the series is arranged alphabetically by topic. Some
				sub-series are arranged chronologically; those are noted within the finding aid
				as appropriate. Letter size folders are followed by legal size folders in two
				runs.</p>

				affiliated with the OAAA. Early in the 20th century, the OAAA instituted an
				umbrella organizational structure, whereby individual firms would be
				represented by state associations, which would in turn be linked nationally.
				Included here are the constitutions and by-laws of the state associations,
				along with correspondence and publications. Items also display the policy links
				between the national association and its state counterparts.</p>
