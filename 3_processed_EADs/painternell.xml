         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Nell Irvin Painter Papers span the years 1793-2010, with the bulk of the material dating between 1876 and 2007,
        and are primarily composed of the extensive correspondence, writing, research,
        teaching materials, and other professional papers that Painter has produced in
        her long career as a scholar, teacher, and writer in 19th- and
        20th-century American and African American history.  The materials document
        the breadth and depth of Painter's interests and her intellectual and personal
        influence on a generation of historians.  Her varied roles as student, teacher,
        colleague, and mentor are recorded in a wide variety of formats: correspondence
        with colleagues, students, family, and friends; syllabi, department memoranda,
        and meeting minutes from her graduate and faculty positions at Harvard,
        Princeton, and the Universities of North Carolina and Pennsylvania; materials
        from many professional organizations in the fields of African American history,
        Southern history, American studies, and women's studies; and records of her
        speaking engagements, conferences, and meetings.  Painter the historian and
        author are revealed in the extensive notes, photocopies, recordings,
        photographs, manuscripts, and proofs produced in writing many articles and five
        of her major books:
      <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas after
        Reconstruction</title>;
      <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro
        Communist in the South</title>;
      <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon: The United States,
        1877-1919</title>;
      <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol</title>; and
      <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Creating Black Americans: African-American History
        and its Meanings, 1619 to the Present.</title>  The portrait is rounded out by
      the materials in other series: personal files, which include
      materials from her student years at Harvard and abroad in Ghana and France as
      well as personal journals; a few papers of Ghanaian writer Ayi Kwei Armah; photographs, including many historical photographs of African Americans as well as many personal snapshots in color and
      black-and-white; and other non-print media such as audiotapes, audiocassettes,
      videocassettes, and computer diskettes.</p>
         
         <p>Painter's research files contain a wealth of information about many topics in American history: biography of African Americans; biography as a literary form; slavery; Reconstruction; the 1870s migration from the South to Kansas; a
        variety of social reform movements--such as abolition, communism, labor, and
        women's suffrage--and movers, such as Sojourner Truth and Hosea Hudson; and the
        history of social conditions and political change in the United States from the
        early-19th to the mid-20th century, particularly as expressed in race
        relations, in women's history, and in the South. At the same time, Painter's papers also constitute a
        contemporary record of many trends in American culture such as career and educational choices and opportunities for academic women and African American professionals. Her correspondence with students, colleagues, and longtime friends
        such as Nellie Y. McKay, her teaching material and academic files, her papers
        from an array of historians' organizations, and her personal journals each shed
        their own light on these themes. </p>
         
         <p>The collection is arranged in these series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Writings and Research, Teaching Materials, Professional Service, Personal Files, Photographic Materials, Audiovisual Materials,</emph>
            
            <emph render="bold">Electronic Formats,</emph> and a collection of private papers collected by Painter, the <emph render="bold">Ayi Kwei Armah Papers.</emph>  The first four series comprise almost eighty percent of the physical extent of the
        collection and are each divided into several subseries. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
          Series</emph> follows Painter's personal life, education, and professional career from her
        graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s through her retirement from
        Princeton in 2004. </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Research Series</emph> is arranged in seven subseries, the first five of which are based on five of Painter's major books; the final two
        subseries are <emph render="bold">Other Research Topics,</emph> which gathers
        many of Painter's shorter writings, and <emph render="bold">Writings by
        Others.</emph>  With the exception of the last, all the subseries here contain
        correspondence with colleagues and editors; typescript drafts of works; various
        stages of proof; extensive photocopies of archival materials and published articles;
        voluminous notes about her readings and research; and some photographs and
        recordings, most of which have been removed to their respective series for
        preservation. </p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph> documents Painter's work with students and academic
        colleagues at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania,
        the University of North Carolina, Hunter College, and Princeton University. It is arranged into two series:
        <emph render="bold">Courses Subseries</emph>, with syllabi, reading lists,
        and Painter's notes on the development of her courses that reflect the evolution of
        women's studies and African American studies in the curriculum; and the <emph render="bold">Academic Files Subseries</emph>, revealing Painter's many different roles over three decades: graduate student, job applicant, junior and tenured faculty member, dissertation advisor, mentor, and department head.</p>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Service
          Series,</emph> arranged in two subseries, documents Painter's activities
        in the broader academic community beyond her university of employment and her
        personal connections through materials from well over one hundred professional organizations,
        conferences, foundations, committees and task forces, as well as editorial
        boards of journals and publishers with which Painter has worked during her
        career. The <emph render="bold">Engagements Subseries</emph> gathers documents relating to addresses, speeches, and awards ceremonies at some three hundred conferences, meetings, and symposia.</p>
         
         <p>Five smaller series and a gathering of oversize material round out the
        collection. The <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series </emph>
        contains an assortment of records such as curriculum vitae; documents about her family; and some
        records of her student years, especially her travel and study in France and
        Africa.  The series includes some
        three dozen personal journals covering most of the years from 1959-2005 containing entries about her life and career (NOTE: some journals are CLOSED to use; see details in the series note).  The
        <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph> contains several hundred photographs, negatives, and slides, predominantly personal and travel snapshots but also including professional portraits of Painter as
        well as a number of original photographs and reproductions of archival
        photographs she used in her research and writing.  Much of the material in the
        early years of the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials
          Series</emph> is related to her research and writing; by the 1990s, the
        content shifts focus to documenting Painter herself on the occasion of various
        interviews and addresses.  The <emph render="bold">Electronic Formats
          Series</emph> consists of diskettes containing correspondence and drafts of writings.  The
        <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> contains items from several series and subseries are gathered.  The final series in the collection consists not of Painter's own work but that of a Ghanaian novelist and poet; see the <emph render="bold">Ayi Kwei Armah Papers (RESTRICTED)</emph> series note for further information on the provenance and usage of these materials.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Accession 2010-0116 (CLOSED)</emph> (dated from 1978-2010) is an unprocessed addition to the collection. Materials include correspondence, email correspondence, newspaper clippings, board notes, articles, journal articles, CDs with interviews, photographs, notebooks, and other miscellaneous material.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Accession 2011-0173 (CLOSED)</emph> (dated from 2010-2011) is an unprocessed addition to the collection. Materials include correspondence, email correspondence, and miscellaneous printed material.</p>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Note about date range of materials:</emph> The
        primary material produced by Painter begins around 1959 with her earliest
        journals. Earlier dates in various series, occurring mainly in Writings and
        Research, reflect the intellectual content and original publication of the
        large volume of reproduced research material present in the collection.</p>

               <p>Contains professional correspondence between Painter and her
            professors, colleagues, and students over the course of her career; personal
            letters to and from family, friends, and colleagues; and some administrative
            and interdepartmental memoranda from each of the universities at which Painter
            served as professor. Documents Painter's personal life, education, and career
            from her graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s up through her retirement
            from Princeton in 2004. Major figures who corresponded with Painter include
            African-American novelist
            Toni Morrison; professors of English
            Houston A. Baker, Jr.,
                  Werner Sollors, and
            Nellie Y. McKay; and historians
            Darlene Clark Hine and
            William L. Andrews. Theirs and others'
            correspondence may appear in either the Chronological Subseries or Alphabetical
            Subseries. Professional correspondence also includes some letters related to
            editorial matters, organizations such as the National Endowment for the
            Humanities, and such publishers as
            Heinneman of the African Writer's Series.

                  <emph render="bold">Materials Retrieval Note:</emph> In addition to the material gathered in this series, Painter's extensive
            correspondence can be found in many other places in the collection. This is
            particularly true of the
            Writings and Research Series and the
            Professional Service Series. In the case of
            the former, each of the five subseries for Painter's major books contains a
            Correspondence subgroup within it related to research and publication of the
            book, and correspondence also appears in various folders throughout the other
            two subseries. In the Professional Service Series, correspondence appears in
            both subseries--Organizations and Engagements--though more substantially in the former. Thus in order to be sure of seeing all correspondence that might relate to a particular book, for example, patrons should retrieve not only the correspondence from that book's subseries in the Writings and Research Series, but also any boxes in the Correspondence Series that originate from any applicable time spans or persons in the Chronological and Alphabetical subseries, respectively.</p>

                  <p> Arranged in chronological order by year, month, and, in some
              places, day. Where possible, Painter's own system of labeling has been
              retained, which accounts for some overlap in dates across folders. Materials
              from the mid to late 1990s and early 2000 often have been divided into the
              categories
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">professional,</title>
                     
                     <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">business,</title> and
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">personal</title> as Painter saw fit,
            and the folders containing these materials have been so labeled along with the
            year and, at times, month. Printed electronic correspondence was largely
            separated by Painter from traditionally-formatted letters when it first began
            to appear in the mid-1990s and has been retained in her folders; after a few
            years, however, she began to treat e-mail as any other correspondence and by
            2002 was interfiling items regardless of how they originated. </p>

                     <emph render="bold">Processing and retrieval note for 2008 and 2010 accessions:</emph> There have been two substantial expansions of this subseries since the collection was originally processed in 2006. Materials from Accession 2008-0016 were integrated into the subseries chronologically but not physically, meaning that newer box numbers will sometimes appear out of strict numerical sequence. Materials from Accession 2010-0116 were processed minimally, and can be found appended at the end of this inventory. Researchers are advised to examine all these points when seeking to retrieve all correspondence from a particular period of time, especially materials dated 1997 or later.</p>

              covered by the privacy and confidentiality agreement signed by all researchers
              appear at many points throughout the collection, but they are especially
              concentrated in this subseries. During processing, all grades, social security
              numbers, and various medical information were removed or redacted when they
              were found, but this does not guarantee all such items were located. In
              addition, material such as letters of recommendation, commentary on students'
              writing or performance, and other potentially sensitive information appears and
              was retained in many folders. Researchers should review the confidentiality
              agreement or consult with Research Services staff if they have questions about
              the appropriate use of this material. </p>

              English). McKay went on to become a professor of American and African-American
              Literature and published important works on Toni Morrison and Jean Toomer among
              other writers. She spent most of her career at the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison. Bulk of subseries consists of correspondence from McKay, but
              several years into the sequence many copies of Painter's letters begin to
              appear, too. Letters cover the personal and professional lives of both women,
              enriched by a variety of attachments, including drafts of writings, newspaper
              clippings about their careers and current events, promotional materials,
              snapshots, and sometimes copies of correspondence with third parties. Arranged
              chronologically, although researchers should note that Painter's original
              labeling on the folders is not always complete. Often the correspondence inside
              the folders covers a longer span of months than she indicated; this has been
              amended in pencil, but items were not shifted between or within folders, so
              contiguous folders should be examined for particular weeks or months. </p>

                  </title> (2010). Each subseries is further divided into three subgroups, Correspondence,
          Drafts, and Research Materials; see specific subseries notes for further detail
          about the arrangement and content of these categories for each book. Materials
          unrelated to these five books--or whose relationship to them could not be
          established--have been placed in one of the final two subseries,
          <emph render="bold">Other Research Topics</emph> or <emph render="bold">Writings by Others.</emph> Note that while all the subseries
          contain writings by other authors, the main criterion for placing materials in
          Writings by Others is that the folder contains only such writing. If a folder
          contains Painter's notes and commentary in addition to writings by other
          authors or contains works by multiple authors that Painter gathered under a
          topical heading, then they are placed in one of the first five subseries or in
          Other Research Topics. This subseries, the largest in the Writings and Research
          Series, is further divided into subgroups by topic; see its subseries note for
          further details on its arrangement.</p>
               
               <p>Several types of documents that appear in this series are
            supported by related material in other series. Three are of particular note:
            correspondence, addresses, and writing by other authors. Much correspondence
            appears in various subseries in Writings and Research, and it addresses many of
            the same topics broached in the Correspondence Series; it can be searched
            alphabetically or chronologically according to the arrangement of the
            particular subseries. Drafts of Painter's addresses and articles have generally
            been placed in the Writings and Research Series--especially in the Other
            Research Topics Subseries--if the folders consist mainly of substantive drafts
            of the work or research on it; but other versions may also appear in the
            Engagements Subseries of the Professional Service Series. Finally, a
            substantial amount of writing by other authors, especially when those authors
            were current or former students or advisees of Painter's, appears in two other
            series. Most such material appears as attachments to letters in the
            Student/Candidate Files Subseries of the Correspondence Series; a smaller
            amount, in the form of drafts unattached to correspondence, appears at the end
            of the Teaching Materials Series, Academic Files Subseries.</p>
               
               <p>As mentioned in the Collection Overview, the dating of folder
            titles is of particular note in this series due to the large volume of
            photocopies and microform printouts of archival and historical material. If the
            folder contains Painter's notes or quotations from a primary source, the date
            corresponds to the time Painter worked on the subject. If the folder contains
            an original source or photocopy of one (almost always the latter), the date
            corresponds to when the intellectual content was originally produced or
            published.</p>

                  <p>Materials have been organized into three subgroups,
              Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. Correspondence also includes
              book reviews. The Drafts subgroup consists of typescripts and printer's proofs.
              Related writings and speeches by Painter are organized with the research
              materials. The materials in the Correspondence and Research Materials subgroups
              are arranged alphabetically, while those in the Drafts subgroup are arranged
              chronologically. Because they lack precise date information, three typescripts
              and three printer's proofs have been labeled A to C. This labeling does not
              reflect any chronological ordering among those documents. In the Research
              Materials subgroup, articles by Painter are indicated by (NIP); writings by
              others are listed alphabetically by last name. The designations "(d)" and "(w)"
              she occasionally places after the names of certain newspapers indicate whether
              it was a daily or weekly publication, respectively.</p>

              Negro Communist in the South</title> (1979), as well as related talks and
            articles by Painter.</p>
                  
                  <p>Materials have been divided into three subgroups:
              Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. The Correspondence subgroup
              largely consists of publication-related materials and correspondence between
              Painter and Hudson, which began in 1976 and lasted through 1982. Many of
              Hudson's letters contain newspaper articles that he routinely clipped, typed
              notes onto, and attached to the letter. Other items of note in the subgroup
              include readers' reports and Painter's replies to them and a letter of
              consignment for the Hudson interview tapes, which Painter donated to the
              Southern Oral History Program at the
              University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
              where they are housed in the Southern Historical Collection. </p>
                  
                  <p>The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of materials
              used in verifying and annotating the text. Hudson's FBI file is of particular
              interest. Also contained are several interview transcripts and related articles
              and talks by Painter, including her talk at UNC, <emph render="doublequote">How

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The materials contained in the Correspondence and Research
              Materials subgroups have been organized alphabetically. The folder titles for
              articles or talks by Painter begin with the work's title, followed by
              <emph render="doublequote">(NIP)</emph>. Folder titles for works by other
              others are organized by author, last name first. The materials in the Drafts
              subgroup are organized chronologically.</p>

                  <p>Contains correspondence, reviews, photos, comments from readers,
              and research materials for
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol</title>
            (1996), as well as related talks and articles by Painter. Divided into three
            subgroups: Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. The Correspondence
            subgroup includes materials regarding fellowships Painter received, reviews,
            photos, answers to questions regarding <emph render="italic">Sojourner
            Truth</emph>, publication information, and requests for others to review drafts
            of her chapters. These items have been ordered alphabetically.</p>
                  
                  <p>Painter sent a number of typescript chapter drafts to other
              scholars. The Drafts subgroup largely consists of the drafts that these
              scholars returned, with their comments and suggestions. The majority of the
              drafts are of the first three chapters, but a few copies of chapters four and
              five are also included. These items have been organized chronologically.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of notes,
              articles, and photocopies of book chapters and letters. There are also a number
              of talks and articles by Painter in relation to <emph render="italic">Sojourner
              Truth</emph>. In particular, there are several folders with materials relating
              to the chapter
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Difference, Slavery, and Memory:
              Sojourner Truth in Feminist Abolitionism,</title> which appeared in Jean Fagan
            Yellin and John C. Van Horne's <emph render="italic">The Abolitionist
            Sisterhood: Women's Political Culture in Antebellum America</emph>. At the time
            the materials in the collection were prepared, the chapter was known only by
            its subtitle and the book was called <emph render="italic">An Untrodden
            Path</emph>. Also of interest is an article by Richard Powell, which is related
            to a chapter in
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth</title> on photography and
            representations of Truth. Other materials relevant to this topic, particularly
            cartes de visite, are found in the Writings by Others Subseries and the
            Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries. The Research
            Materials subgroup has been ordered alphabetically.</p>

              and extensive research materials related to Painter's work on
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon: The United States,
              1877-1919</title> (1987). Divided into Correspondence, Drafts, and Research
            Materials subgroups.</p>
                  
                  <p>Compared to other subseries, the
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title> Subseries
            contains relatively little correspondence. The existing materials are largely
            publication-related. The correspondence with the Henry George School of Social
            Science includes a lesson plan and quiz questions on <emph render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</emph>. Related correspondence perhaps
            may be found in the Correspondence Series. The Drafts subgroup includes a
            manuscript, several typescripts, and two master proofs. The Research subgroup
            materials include photocopies of scholarly articles, newspaper articles, and
            Congressional records, as well as extensive notes from those materials and
            books. The subgroup also includes talks, reviews, and articles by Painter. </p>
                  
                  <p> In addition to materials directly about the book, all materials
              in the Writings and Research Series involving the issues of labor, gender, and
              race, as they relate to the economic and political conditions of the late
              nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, have been incorporated into the
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title> Subseries.
            The subseries also includes materials on the South that are relevant to the
            period addressed by
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title>.</p>
                  
                  <p>The correspondence and research materials are arranged
              alphabetically, while the drafts are arranged chronologically. Talks or
              articles by Painter have generally been identified by
              <emph render="doublequote">(NIP)</emph> following the work's title. As three
              typescripts of
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title> lack any date
            information, they have been labeled A to C. This labeling does not reflect any
            chronological ordering among those typescripts. In addition, inasmuch as their
            dating is uncertain, those typescripts have been placed after the other
            typescripts in the subseries.</p>

                     <p>The largest subgroup in the Other Research Topics Subseries.
                Contains work that either did not fit within one of the other subgroups, or
                that was equally relevant to several topics. Includes materials that cover the
                general topics of racism and African-American history, as well as issues
                surrounding
                political correctness, race and money, and
                language. Of particular interest are the materials about the
                Somerset reunion, a reunion of all the
                families associated with a former slave plantation in
                North Carolina, and three fictional works
                of unknown origin.</p>

                     <p>Contains materials on the differences between African-American
                and Southern history;
                emancipation; the
                Ku Klux Klan; identity, blood and race;
                and Reconstruction. Because of the number of materials on Reconstruction, these
                have been organized into a group within Southern History. Many of the materials
                in this subgroup relate to a work on the South and identity that Painter
                proposed and researched, which she entitled
              <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">American Views of the South.</title>
              Although it was not written, some of the themes for this work are addressed in
              Painter's introductory essay for
              <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Secret Eye,</title> which was
              reprinted in

                     <p>Materials compiled by Painter while working in the late 1980s
                with one of her students, Leah Hagedorn, on a reprint edition (never published)
                of the novels of
                Walter White, an early 20th century
                African American author and chief executive of the
                NAACP from 1929-1935. Subgroup contains
                copies of correspondence to, from, and about White; copies of his newspapers
                columns, fiction manuscripts, and other writings; and Painter's original
                correspondence, drafts, and notes about White's life and work. Arranged
                alphabetically based on Painter's original folder titles; descriptive words
                such as "correspondence" and "photocopies" were added as needed to clarify
                folder contents.</p>

                  <p>Consists of drafts, published works, and lectures by family
              members, colleagues, and other individuals. Although Painter probably used
              these materials for her own research, they have been placed in the Writings by
              Others Subseries because they were unrelated to, or could not be particularly
              identified with, any of her major books. Moreover, they have not been included
              among the materials in the Other Research Topics Subseries, although they
              frequently include notes or marginalia by Painter, because Painter organized
              these materials in such a way that the work in each folder is primarily the
              work of a single author other than herself. Correspondence, including notes
              from those sending materials to Painter, can be found in some folders, and
              related material from some authors may also be found in the Correspondence
              Series.</p>
                  
                  <p>Significant topics covered in the subseries include
              feminism, photography, and the
              history of photography. Other materials on
              photography are found in the
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth</title> Subseries and the
            Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries. Of interest is a
            work by Painter's mother,
            Dona Irvin, about the members of
            Downs Memorial United Methodist Church. The
            work focuses on the lives of middle-class African-Americans rather than
            prominent figures or the underprivileged. Here entitled
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Downs People,</title> it was published
            as

                  <p>Materials in the Writings by Others Subseries are arranged

              university and department forms and invoices, printed materials, files on
              students for whom Painter served as advisor or committee member, student
              writings, and other materials. Arranged alphabetically by institution (Harvard,
              Princeton, University of North Carolina, University of Pennsylvania, and
              Wellesley College), then chronologically within those groups. At the end of the
              series are several folder groups that span Painter's years in various
              positions, arranged alphabetically by topic. The largest of these are
              Applications and Job Searches, containing correspondence and other documents
              relating to various positions and fellowships she sought at different times;
              and Student Writings, containing various papers, theses, and dissertations
              written by Painter's students. Note that student files gathered here are mainly
              writings that were found unattached to correspondence and represent only a
              fraction of such material; the bulk of her extensive correspondence with her
              students, including discussion and copies of their research and writing, is in
              the Correspondence Series.</p>

               <p>Contains information about Painter's personal life and, to a
            lesser extent, her family and her professional career.  Materials include copies
            of her
            curricula vitae through the years; awards
            and honors; biographical citations about her from various reference works;
            clippings; appointment calendars and telephone logs; information about a number
            of family members, especially her parents; class notes and other documents from
            her student years abroad in Ghana and France; and over three dozen of her
            personal journals.  By far, the journals are
            the most substantive item in the series in both richness and quantity of
            information.  In more than five thousand manuscript pages Painter records
            details of her personal and professional life and her thoughts about her
            writing for almost thirty years, up to 1989; there then follows a gap of nine
            years before the journals resume in 1998, though in considerably less detail. 
            Arranged alphabetically by category in the following folder groups:
            Biographical, Calendars and Contacts, Family and Friends, Journals, Student
            Years, and Other Personal Papers.  Folders are then arranged chronologically in
            those categories with the exception of the alphabetical arrangements of Family
            and Friends and Other Personal Papers.</p>

            photographs, 170 35mm slides, and several hundred negatives.  Predominantly
            made up of reproductions Painter used as part of her research for various
            writings and a wide variety of original, personal snapshots. Arranged in three
            subseries related to major series in the main body of the collection:

            Photographs and Negatives.</emph> In addition, there are also three format groups that have been separated from the three intellectual series and housed separately based on the archival needs of the materials in question: <emph render="bold">Large Prints,</emph>

                  <p>Contains approximately 160 black-and-white photographs, nine
              color photographs, eight 35mm slides, and a few negatives.  There are a few
              original photographs, most notably a carte-de-visite of Soujourner Truth, but the majority mainly consists of reproductions from various state archives and the Library of Congress that Painter used as part of her research
              fopr various writings.  Much of the material appears to be research for
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Exodusters</title> and, to a lesser extent,
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Narrative of Hosea Hudson,</title> but
            other writings are also represented. Arranged in chronological order. Prints
            8x10 and larger are housed separately in flat boxes and follow the main list in
            a separate chronological sequence, with negatives for a few of the prints at
            the end of the subseries.</p>

                     <p>Processor's note: three contact sheets with no positive
                identification other than place, but posters of individual Greensboro Five
                members and the presence of armored vehicles in some photographs indicate that
                this is likely the funeral for victims of the riot of November 3, 1979. See

              color photographs, one hundred twenty-two 35mm slides, and many negatives. Consists mainly
              of personal snapshots taken by Painter and her family and
              friends.  There are several early photographs of family members, including a 1914 print of her mother's family in Texas.  After the late 1970s there are also a number of formal portraits and
              publicity photographs of Painter (noted as "NIP"). Arranged in two chronological sequences: additions to this subseries received in accession 2008-0016 were so extensive as to render impractical the virtual interfiling technique used throughout the rest of this finding aid. Therefore boxes 229-231 contain the personal photographs received in 2006 and earlier, and boxes 275-278 contain those received in 2008. Note that the more recently received group is not only larger but also covers a longer span of years, beginning earlier and ending later.
