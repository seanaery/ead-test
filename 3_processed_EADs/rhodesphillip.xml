                  <p>Beginning in 1973 (and continuing for a number of years), the Berea College Country Dancers and the McLain Family Bluegrass Band were engaged by the CIncinnati Symphony Orchestra to tour with the orchestra's summer programs.  It was a good, old-fashioned event: the CSO softball team would play the local team in the afternoon, followed by a picnic supper, and ending with a concert (usually outdoors) in the evening.  Enclosed is the program book from 1974.</p>
                  
                  <p>Since I was at the time Composer-in-Residence for the Kentucky State Arts Commission, I was hired by the CSO to do the orchestral arrangements for both groups.</p>
                  
                  <p>My work with the MCLain Family Band eventually led to the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Concerto for Bluegrass Band and Orchestra (a.k.a. Bluegrass Festival Suite)</title> which was commissioned jointly by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Kentucky Arts Commission to celebrate the national bicentennial.  This work has subsequently been performed more than 200 times from Alaska to Florida. <emph render="italic">(PR)</emph>
