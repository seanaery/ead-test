               <p>Acc. (2010-0059) (3.6 lin. ft.; dated 1940s-1990s) includes hundreds of photographs from the Sanford family. The majority of these date from the 1980s and 1990s, while there are some earlier black and white prints from the 1940s and 1950s. Most are not labeled. There are also 2 photograph albums of family vacations to Africa (1988) and Europe (1990s). This material requires processing before use.</p>
