         <abstract>Collection consists of correspondence, financial papers, legal papers, writings and speeches, scrapbooks, pictures, and miscellaneous material reflecting the philanthropic, cultural and social activities of the Semans family. A major focus is the interrelationship of the Semans family with the Biddle, Duke, and Trent families. Additionally, the papers document the roles of Mary Duke Biddle, James H. Semans and Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans have taken in the development of arts and educational programs throughout North Carolina. To a lesser degree, the papers reflect on childcare during the early 20th century.</abstract>

         <p>Dr. Semans's extensive commitment to the areas of vocational and
                         physical rehabilitation began while he was in the Army and developed into an interest in local, state, and national programs. He served on the boards of the United Medical Research Foundation of North Carolina (1956); the National Rehabilitation Association, N.C. Chapter (1955-1958) [Life Member of the national organization]; the National Paraplegia Foundation (1955-1972); the Board of Directors of Operation Breakthrough [a Durham vocational rehabilitation program] (1965-1967); and the Governor's Executive Committee on Employment of the Handicapped (1965-1971). He was named Mary Switzer Scholar at New York University in 1984. He lectured worldwide on the subject of urology.</p>
         
         <p>The primary institutional focus of Dr. Semans's support of the arts is the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, N.C., and activities extending from that commitment, including the promotion of artists of all types. His position with the school involves him in many other arts-related activities including the North Carolina Arts Council (1982?). Dr. Semans was a trustee of Louisburg and Warren Wilson colleges and is on the Board of Trustees of the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation (1960-).</p>
         
         <p>Many organizations have recognized Dr. Semans's achievements with awards. These include the National Conference of Christians and Jews National Brotherhood Award (1969); the North Carolina Award for Significant Contributions to the Arts (1972); and the North Carolina Society Award (1986). Each of these awards was received jointly with Mary D.B.T. Semans.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The papers of the Semans family span the years 1878 to 2008. The
                  collection consists of four sub-groups of papers: the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Mary Duke Biddle Family
                  Papers</ref>, the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">James H. Semans Family Papers</ref>, the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">James H. and Mary D.B.T. Semans
                  Family Papers</ref>, and the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Elizabeth Lucina Gotham Family Papers</ref>.</p>
         
         <p>The collection reflects the philanthropic, cultural, and social
                  activities of the Semans family. Major focuses are the interrelationships of the Semans family with the Biddle, Duke, and Trent families. Additionally the papers document the roles Mary Duke Biddle, James H. Semans, and Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans have taken in the development of arts and educational programs throughout North Carolina. To a lesser degree, the papers reflect on childcare during the early twentieth century.</p>
         
         <p>Individuals represented include Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Nicholas Benjamin Duke Biddle, Angier Biddle Duke, Angier Buchanan Duke, Benjamin Newton Duke, Sarah Pearson Angier Duke, Elizabeth Lucina Gotham, and Josiah Charles Trent as well as other members of the Duke, Biddle, Trent, and Semans families. Political and educational leaders are also represented.</p>
         
         <p>Subject areas represented include: arts; charities; childcare; The Duke Endowment; Duke University and other universities and colleges; the North Carolina School of the Arts; education; genealogy; personal finances; philanthropy; Durham, N.C., politics and social life; vocational rehabilitation; and the Methodist church.</p>
         
         <p>For additional collections of Duke family papers, see the Washington Duke Papers, the Benjamin Newton Duke Papers, and the James B. Duke Papers. For further information on the contributions of the Duke family to Duke University, contact the Duke University Archives.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Mary Duke Biddle Family Papers</ref> span the years 1894 to 1960, although the bulk of the material dates from the 1920s to the 1930s. They consist of correspondence, legal papers, scrapbooks, pictures, address books, miscellaneous expense accounts, wedding memorabilia, baby books, and other materials relating to Mrs. Biddle's personal and family life, and social, cultural, and philanthropic activities.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence series consists primarily of correspondence to and from Mary Duke Biddle, but also includes correspondence to and from Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, Benjamin N. Duke, Sarah P. Duke, Angier Buchanan Duke, Mary D.B.T. Semans and Nicholas Benjamin Duke Biddle, and Duke University officers, board members, and faculty. There is also a significant amount of correspondence from Duke family business managers that relates to Mrs. Biddle's private finances and correspondence from Mrs. Biddle to Duke University wherein she continued the Duke family tradition of giving to Duke University. Some legal papers relating to financial transactions and purchases are interspersed with correspondence. There are many condolences addressed to Mrs. Biddle on the deaths of her brother, father, and mother as well as other materials relating to the death and funeral of B.N. Duke. Additional materials related to the death of Benjamin N. Duke are in the Benjamin Newton Duke Papers.</p>
         
         <p>The Scrapbooks Series contains newspaper society page clippings about the Duke and Biddle families and Duke University. Some scrapbooks contain correspondence to and from Benjamin N. Duke, primarily related to Duke University. Mrs. Biddle's interest in the performing arts is reflected in scrapbooks which contain primarily photomechanical pictures of opera and theater celebrities.</p>
         
         <p>Four autochrome portraits of Mrs. Biddle and Sarah P. Duke are in the Pictures Series. The autochromes, a rare early color photographic process, are displayed in diascope cases and date from about 1910. Other pictures are of Mrs. Biddle and her family and friends at Biddle's Durham residence "Pinecrest" in the 1950s. Numerous pictures of Mary Duke Biddle are also found in the Pictures Series of the James H. and Mary D.B.T. Semans Family Papers.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">James H. Semans Family Papers</ref> span the years 1878 to
                         1953, with the bulk of the materials dating from the 1930s and 1940s. They
                         consist of genealogical materials, correspondence, financial papers, legal
                         papers, writings and speeches, scrapbooks, calendars, printed materials,
                         student and professional reports, pictures, and miscellaneous materials
                         relating to the Semans family of Uniontown, Pa. The papers particularly
                         describe the life of James H. Semans, including the academic and professional
                         course Dr. Semans took toward becoming a physician and the early years of his
                         medical practice, before his marriage to Mary Duke Biddle Trent in 1953.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence Series especially illustrates Dr. Semans's
                         relationships with his parents and several other family members and his medical
                         training and career. Dr. Semans carried on considerable correspondence with his
                         parents during the 1930s and 1940s, and with his sister Virginia and her
                         husband Wendell A. Stone in the 1940s. The letters describe family life and Dr.
                         Semans's academic, professional, and personal life. Many of these letters were
                         written during Semans's medical residencies at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
                         Baltimore, St. Mary's Hospital in Pierre, S.D., Ancker Hospital in St. Paul,
                         Minn., and various military base hospitals. He served on the urological service
                         of Dr. Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. There are also scattered
                         letters from acquaintances.</p>
         
         <p>From 1938 to 1939 Dr. Semans served a medical internship in Pierre,
                         S.D. In a series of letters to his parents he describes his work at the
                         hospital and relationships with members of the staff, his impressions of the
                         community and citizens including American Indians, and the surrounding
                         countryside. Notable are Dr. Semans's descriptions of his St. Mary's Hospital
                         mentor, Dr. Theodore E. Riggs, grandson of Stephen R. Riggs, a missionary to
                         Indians. [Dr. Riggs is also mentioned in letters dated March 31 and April 15,
                         1944.]</p>
         
         <p>Beginning in 1946 the bulk of correspondence occurs between J.H.
                         Semans and his medical colleagues. Much of it concerns the establishment of his
                         Atlanta medical practice, arrangements for professional meetings and
                         organizations, personnel references and other professional matters. There is
                         some correspondence between Dr. Semans and his patients. The latter part of
                         1953 includes information on Dr. Semans's establishment of a medical practice
                         in North Carolina and family and personal correspondence related to his
                         marriage to Mary D.B. Trent.</p>
         
         <p>Most of the letters from the 1880s and early 1900s in the
                         Correspondence Series are addressed to the father of James H. Semans, Thomas B.
                         Semans, a successful businessman. They relate to family matters and business
                         investments, including a coal enterprise in New Zealand. The Financial Papers
                         Series and the Legal Papers Series include personal financial records created
                         by Thomas B. Semans and records pertaining to his estate. The Writings and
                         Speeches Series includes periodic diary entries made by Dr. Semans. Most diary
                         entries date to 1946 wherein he describes various trips he made as he looked
                         for a location to establish a medical practice. Most of the medical papers and
                         speeches were prepared for medical professionals but some speeches were
                         presented to local service clubs.</p>
         
         <p>The Scrapbook Series includes photographs, clippings, and
                         correspondence from Dr. Hugh H. Young and others. Dr. Semans compiled and
                         annotated an autobiographical scrapbook for the years 1910 to 1952. Types of
                         materials similar to those in this scrapbook are located in the
                         autobiographical files of the Speeches and Writings Series of the James H. and
                         Mary D.B.T. Semans Family Papers.</p>
         
         <p>There are a variety of family photographs, chiefly of members of the
                         Semans family, in the Pictures Series. There are some formal pictures of
                         children's birthday parties (1910s, 1920s) and Uniontown houses, and some
                         candid photographs made in Atlanta, Ga., and Pierre, S.D. There are copy
                         photographs of Semans family ancestors made from a cartes de visite album. See
                         the James H. and Mary D.B.T. Semans Family Papers for pictures of the Semans
                         family dated after 1953.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">James H. and Mary D.B.T. Semans Family Papers</ref> span the
                         years 1925 to 1991. The bulk of the papers date after 1950, except for the
                         Pictures Series which dates from the 1880s to 1990. Included in the papers are
                         genealogical materials, correspondence, financial papers, legal papers, subject
                         files pertaining to the many academic institutions and philanthropic, artistic,
                         and social organizations in which the Semanses are involved, writings and
                         speeches, scrapbooks, pictures, and miscellaneous materials such as audio
                         tapes, awards and certificates, calendars, clippings, motion films, and
                         phonograph records. The papers also document the commitment of the Semans and
                         Trent families to use their personal and financial resources to support
                         artistic endeavors, academic institutions, and research in social welfare and
                         medical programs, particularly in North Carolina.</p>
         
         <p>Papers dating from 1925 to 1953 focus on Mary Duke Biddle Trent
                         Semans; her personal and family life including travel, school life, musical
                         pursuits, her marriage to Josiah Charles Trent and their family life and
                         activities; and her relationship with Elizabeth L. Gotham. Her philanthropic,
                         political, and social activities are also illustrated. The development of Mary
                         and Josiah C. Trent's collection of rare book materials and their donations of
                         these to the academic and medical libraries of Duke University are described,
                         as well as their relationships (and later Dr. Semans's) with book dealers Henry
                         and Ida W. Schuman.</p>
         
         <p>James H. Semans's papers merge with those of Mary Semans beginning
                         in 1953, the year in which the two were introduced and subsequently married.
                         After their marriage materials reflecting the Semanses' joint and individual
                         activities are interspersed throughout the sub-group.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence and Subject Files Series form two of the largest
                         and most important components of the papers. There is much overlap of topics
                         between the two series. The papers demonstrate the continuing interest of Duke
                         family members in the welfare of Duke University and the institutions served by
                         The Duke Endowment. Mary Semans's positions with the Duke University Board of
                         Trustees and numerous committees, the Woman's College, and with The Duke
                         Endowment are documented, especially in the Subject Files Series.
                         Correspondents for Duke University include university presidents, officers and
                         staff, especially Douglas M. Knight, Terry Sanford, Keith Brodie, Thomas L.
                         Perkins, Benjamin E. Powell, and Joel L. Fleishman. Medical Center
                         correspondents include Barnes Woodhall, Wilburt C. Davison, Lenox D. Baker, and
                         William G. Anlyan. The Duke Endowment correspondents include Marshall I.
                         Pickens and Robert McCormack. However, since many of these individuals operated
                         within several organizational spheres, their correspondence may be
                         scattered.</p>
         
         <p>James and Mary Semans's involvements with Duke University's Art and
                         Music departments and other programs and events are described in the
                         Correspondence and Subject Files Series. Mary Semans participated in the
                         development and expansion of the academic and medical libraries. James Semans
                         was instrumental in the expansion of the medical library in the 1950s. Their
                         trusteeship in the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation and its contributions to Duke
                         University and the arts outside of the university are prominently represented.
                         Other educators and civic leaders who corresponded with the Semanses include
                         William C. Friday, George Watts Carr, Jr., and Dan K. Moore.</p>
         
         <p>The North Carolina School of the Arts is heavily supported by the
                         Semanses, particularly by Dr. Semans who is a school founder. The school,
                         including its summer sessions in Siena, Italy, is documented primarily in the
                         Subject Files Series, but references will be found also in the Correspondence
                         and Miscellaneous Series, and additional photographs are in the Pictures
                         Series. The correspondence illustrates the close personal and professional
                         relationships of the Semanses with school staff and students. Prominent people
                         represented in the North Carolina School of the Arts materials include Vittorio
                         Giannini, Robert C. Suderburg, Samuel M. Stone, and Giorgio Ciompi.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence and Subject Files Series document the Semanses'
                         work in the arts and their memberships in many arts organizations, including
                         the Advisory Board of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and the
                         Concert Opera Board of New York City, and James Semans's extensive connections
                         stemming from the North Carolina School of the Arts. Numerous artists, writers,
                         musicians, dancers and art supporters have close ties with the Semanses.
                         Correspondents for these areas include John Ehle, Iain Hamilton, Nancy Hanks,
                         Agnes De Mille, and Archie K. Davis.</p>
         
         <p>The Semanses sponsor music scholarships and prizes, artistic
                         programs and concerts, and have commissioned art and musical works at Duke
                         University, the North Carolina School of the Arts, and elsewhere. A number of
                         endowments, funds, scholarships, and foundations have been started by the
                         Semanses in support of the arts, social and medical research, and other
                         academic endeavors. They also sponsor a collection of art for Duke University
                         in honor of Dr. Semans's parents.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence and Subject Files Series also reflect the
                         extensive involvement of Dr. and Mrs. Semans in medical and vocational
                         rehabilitation in local, state, and national organizations in the late 1950s
                         through the 1960s. There is significant correspondence from Mary Switzer and
                         Howard Rusk for this area. Three major subject files of these materials are
                         Duke University Medical Center, the National Paraplegia Foundation, and
                         Vocational Rehabilitation.</p>
         
         <p>The Correspondence Series also contains information on family,
                         personal, social, and business activities and relationships. There is
                         correspondence from Duke, Biddle, and Semans family members. The close
                         relationships between the Semanses and members of the Trent family of Oklahoma
                         and elsewhere after Josiah C. Trent's death are reflected in the
                         correspondence. The correspondence also reflects many of the Semanses' close
                         personal relationships with people in North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania,
                         Washington, D.C., Italy, and Greece.</p>
         
         <p>The Trent and Semans children, Mary Duke Trent Jones, Sally
                         Elizabeth Trent Harris, Rebecca Gray Trent Kirkland, Barbara Biddle Trent
                         Kimbrell, Jenny L. Semans Koortbojian, James D.B.T. Semans, and Beth Gotham
                         Semans are also described throughout the Correspondence, Pictures, and
                         Miscellaneous Series. This includes information on their academic and
                         professional activities as well as their personal and adult family lives.</p>
         
         <p>Copies of many of the speeches given by the Semanses at the
                         ceremonies in which they received awards and at other public occasions are in
                         the Writings and Speeches Series. Files, including correspondence and other
                         related materials, created by Dr. Semans and his assistants for the publication
                         of an autobiography titled Coming of Age are also in the Writings and Speeches
                         Series. Some of the correspondence in the autobiographical files does not
                         relate to the publication of the book but is background information compiled by
                         Dr. Semans.</p>
         
         <p>The Scrapbooks Series consists of three scrapbooks compiled by Mary
                         D.B.T. Semans during the 1930s. They illustrate her travels across the U.S.,
                         her student years at Duke University, and her courtship with Josiah C.
                         Trent.</p>
         
         <p>People represented in the Pictures Series include the Angier family
                         of North Carolina, the Biddle family of Philadelphia, the Duke family, the
                         Trent family (related through Josiah Charles Trent) of Oklahoma and elsewhere,
                         and the Semans family of Pennsylvania and elsewhere. For most of these
                         individuals there are candid photographs as well as formal portraits. Family
                         oriented subjects include children's birthday parties (1920s), family group
                         Christmas portraits that were also reproduced on Christmas cards (1941-1988),
                         weddings, travel in the U.S. and Europe (1950s-1980s), and leisure in Atlantic
                         City, N.J. (ca. 1915-1920s), southern resorts, and at home. This series
                         provides an opportunity for an examination of affluent society in the 1920s and
                         1930s. A significant number of the pictures were made by professional
                         photographers, and many were reproduced on the newspaper society pages. There
                         are extensive photographs taken in Palm Beach, Fla., showing people engaged in
                         recreational activities and pictures of homes and social clubs.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Elizabeth Lucina Gotham Family Papers</ref> are useful for the study
                         of women's history, particularly that of women trained as baby nurses in the
                         early twentieth century. The papers span the years 1902 to 1968, with the bulk
                         occurring in the 1920s. They include correspondence, pictures, a few
                         genealogical items and clippings. Most of the Correspondence Series consists of
                         letters from Miss Gotham's family and women friends. Many of the latter are
                         evangelistic in nature and include letters mailed from a missionary station in
                         Honduras.</p>
         
         <p>A significant amount of correspondence to Elizabeth Gotham from Mary
                         Semans and her family, which documents their close relationships, is in the
                         James H. and Mary D.B.T. Semans Family Papers Correspondence Series. It dates
                         from about 1938 to 1941 and then is scattered throughout the 1950s and
                         1960s.</p>
         
         <p>The Pictures Series includes photographs of Gotham family members,
                         portraits of nurses and nurses in baby hospitals, and towns in the state of New
                         York.</p>

                     <p>N.B. There are two alphabetical sequences of loose pictures.
                                         Size considerations created the need to store pictures in both flat and upright
                                         boxes. Therefore the first alphabetical sequence refers to pictures in upright
                                         boxes, the second to pictures in flat boxes, e.g., pictures of Anthony J.
                                         Drexel Biddle are in boxes 83 and 90.</p>
