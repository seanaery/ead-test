         <abstract>The Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University teaches, engages in, and presents documentary work grounded in collaborative partnerships and extended fieldwork that uses photography, film/video, audio, and narrative writing to capture and convey contemporary memory, life, and culture. The CDS student documentary projects collection houses work created by students enrolled in courses on documentary studies offered by Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), sponsored by the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke.  The projects focus primarily on the social life and customs of persons living in and around rural and urban areas of Durham, Chatham, and Orange counties, North Carolina.  Includes images of religious life, schools, African Americans, college students at Duke University, migrant workers, North Carolina farmers, and the built environment in various locales, chiefly in Durham, N.C.  Project formats typically consist of black-and-white photographs and slides, but newer submissions also contain digital color prints and media such as cassette tapes, videos, and CD-ROMs.  Oral histories of N.C. civil rights and labor activists and other individuals are associated with certain courses.  Audiovisual materials may require reformatting before use.  Acquired by the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>Collection houses documentary projects created by students enrolled in courses on documentary studies offered by Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), from 1980 to 2010.  Most of the student projects focus on the social life and customs of persons living in and around Durham, Chatham, and Orange counties, North Carolina.  Includes images of life in cities and towns, particularly in Durham; rural life; schools and other institutions such as churches and retirement homes, and charitable organizations such as soup kitchens and orphanages; other community centers such as stores, daycares, and laundromats; African American communities and neighborhoods, particularly in Durham; migrant workers; midwives; and Duke University students and campus life. One series of images portrays the Chuck Davis African American Dance Ensemble in Durham. Oral histories of N.C. civil rights and labor activists and other individuals are associated with certain courses.  Many of the projects include written reports and essays.</p>
         
         <p>The majority of projects depict Durham area locales, but other cities and towns in N.C. include Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, Raleigh, Seagrove, Wanchese, Cane Creek, Oxford, Carrboro, Orange Factory, Rougemont, Saxapahaw, Salisbury, Northside, Corinth, and Cedar Grove.  There are a few photos from Virginia, and there are a few summer projects that come from Boston, Tel-Aviv, and Tennessee.</p>
         
         <p>Also includes grant-supported projects by professional documentarians: Eric Green, Kate Rhodenbaugh, Carolina Wang, and Donna Lennard, and photographic work by Bill Bamberger, a faculty member at Duke.</p>
         
         <p>Black-and-white prints make up the majority of formats, but there are also many slides. Recent additions also include oral histories on audio cassettes and there are a few CD-ROMS associated with projects. These are marked in the folder descriptions. Original audiovisual and electronic media are closed to use and may require the production of use copies before they can be accessed.</p>
         
         <p>The courses were all sponsored by the Center for Documentary Photography, which in 1989 changed its name to the
	  Center for Documentary Studies. Among the faculty teaching courses for the Center for Documentary Studies were
	  Alex Harris, Bill Bamberger, and Margaret Sartor, all of whom have contributed their own documentary work to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.</p>
