         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The William Styron Papers span the years 1855-2007 with the bulk of the papers being dated between 1943 and 1996.  The collection is arranged into the following series: Correspondence, Writings by Styron (which includes Separate Publications, Contributions to Books and Periodicals, Speeches, Unfinished Work, and Miscellaneous Writings), Writings by Others, Printed Material, Audiovisual Material, Scrapbooks, and Miscellaneous Material. Extensive personal and professional correspondence between Styron and his family, friends, editors, and fellow authors provides insight into his education at Duke University (particularly his studies with Professor William Blackburn of the Department of English) as well as his literary career and personal life.  The Writings by Styron Series includes numerous drafts, notes, manuscripts, and proofs of his novels, essays, speeches, and articles.  Critical and analytical works concerning Styron's writing can be found in both the Printed Material Series and the Writings by Others Series.
