         <bioghist>
            
            <p>John S. Bradway was born Feb. 17, 1890 in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania to William and Jennie S. Bradway. He graduated from Haverford College with an A.B. in 1911 and an A.M. in 1915. He received his law degree from University of Pennsylvania in 1914 and received an honorary law degree from Haverford in 1957.  Bradway began his academic teaching career at the University of Pennsylvania where he taught in the Sociology Department from 1927 to 1928.  At the same time, he taught at the Pennsylvania School of Social and Health Work (1927-1929). In 1929 he moved to California and began a short career at the University of Southern California Law School (1929-1931). Bradway moved to Durham in 1931 where he taught law at Duke from 1931 to 1959. After leaving Durham, Bradway taught at the Hastings College of Law in San Francisco and at California Western University until his retirement in 1970. Bradway was married to Mary Henderson in 1921. He died on January 2, 1985 in Eureka, California. </p>
            
            <p>Bradway's primary interest and work was in the field of legal aid. He served as Secretary of the National Association of Legal Aid Organizations (NALAO) from 1922-1940, and as its President from 1940-1942. While at Duke, Bradway founded and directed the Duke Legal Aid Clinic from 1931 until 1959. The purpose of the Clinic was to provide practical training for law students. They participated in practical activities such as conferring with clients, gaining interview skills, and preparing a real case for trial. Students acquired skills in legal writing through the preparation of trial briefs and legal memoranda. The Clinic served clients who were unable to pay counsel fees, most often the indigent, immigrants, minorities, and servicemen.  In addition to Bradway, the Clinic had a staff of five members of the North Carolina State Bar who assisted in educational and supervisory activities, as well as representing the Clinic's clients in court.  Bradway lobbied throughout his career for law schools to make a commitment for student training through legal aid clinics. </p>
            
            <p>Bradway's service to the legal aid community was extensive. He chaired the legal aid committees of the Pennsylvania and North Carolina Bar Associations, as well as the Legal Aid Clinics Committee of the Association of American Law Schools. He was also an active member of the National Conference of Social Work, the American Association of Social Workers, the International Bar Association, and served as chair of the Research Committee for the Interprofessional Commission on Marriage and Divorce Laws. </p>
            
            <p>His dedication to social service and legal aid extended to state and local organizations. He served as president of the North Carolina Conference for Social Service, North Carolina Mental Hygiene Society, State Legislative Council, and as director of the North Carolina League for Crippled Children. In Durham, Bradway was president of the Durham Council of Social Agencies, Family Service Agency, Rotary Club, and the Crime Study Club. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the Durham Child Guidance Clinic, Salvation Army Home and Hospital, YWCA, and Community Chest. In addition, he was chair of a committee appointed by the Durham City Council to establish a Juvenile Court in 1933, and of a committee appointed to study sub-standard housing in 1948. </p>
            
            <p>Bradway wrote extensively on the topic of legal aid. His publications include: </p>
