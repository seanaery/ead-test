         <abstract>Born on November 22, 1912, Doris Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke, a founder of the American Tobacco Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of Duke University, and Nanaline Holt Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in 1925, which included Duke Farms in New Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a mansion in New York City, Doris was soon dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the world." Although Doris did her best to live a private life, she contributed to a number of public causes and was an active supporter of the arts, historic preservation, and the environment. Doris Duke died in October 1993 at the age of 80. In her will she left the majority of her estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The Doris Duke Papers were created by combining materials maintained by staff at the Duke Business Office and/or household staff of the Main Residence, on Doris Duke's behalf. It mostly contains the personal papers generated by or about Doris Duke throughout her lifetime. The collection covers the period 1798 to 2003, although the majority of the collection is concentrated in the 1930s to 1993. The collection is organized into 9 series limited to Doris Duke's personal relationships, dealings, and interests: Administrative Records, Personal Correspondence, Financial Records, Legal Records, Reports and Summaries, Subject Files, and Duke Business Office Safe.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>Born on November 22, 1912, Doris Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke, a founder of the American Tobacco Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of Duke University, and Nanaline Holt Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in 1925, which included Duke Farms in New Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a mansion in New York City, Doris was soon dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the world." Although Doris did her best to live a private life, she carried on the Duke family's pattern of philanthropy by contributing to a number of public causes such as the arts, historic preservation, and the environment. When she was 21 she established Independent Aid, a foundation which would later became the Doris Duke Foundation. Adventurous, intelligent and independent, Doris Duke was determined not to be defined by social expectations or her vast wealth. She traveled widely and pursued her many interests including music, dance, writing, and art. Doris Duke was married twice, first to James H.R. Cromwell and then to Porfirio Rubirosa. Both marriages ended in divorce. Doris Duke died in October 1993 at the age of 80. In her will she left the majority of her estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Doris Duke papers (formerly MSS.001) is part of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Historical Archives which were donated to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The collection is artificial in nature, created by combining materials maintained by staff at the Duke Business Office and/or household staff of the Main Residence, on Doris Duke's behalf. It mostly contains the personal papers generated by or about Doris Duke throughout her lifetime. Since Doris Duke's staff maintained her professional and personal records, often in the same filing structures, materials regarding her personal life were intermingled throughtout the larger collection. In order to improve access to important documents, all materials of a personal nature were selected out and incorporated into this collection. The only major exception is Series VII: Duke Business Office Safe, where the personal and professional contents of the office are maintained together to preserve the integrity of the materials and serve as a testament to business operations.</p>
         
         <p>The Doris Duke Papers covers the period 1798 to 2003, although the majority of the collection is concentrated in the 1930s to 1993. The collection is divided into 7 series limited to Doris Duke's personal relationships, dealings, and interests: Administrative Records, Personal Correspondence <emph render="bold">(RESTRICTED)</emph>, Financial Records, Legal Records, Reports and Summaries, Subject Files, and Duke Business Office Safe.</p>

               <p>This series contains an assortment of materials related to the broad and varied business and personal activities of Doris Duke. Materials related to business activities include correspondence, agendas, reports, and minutes from Doris Duke's business team. Topics range from investments, new ventures (including the chartering of the Newport Restoration Foundation), and loans, to job descriptions, stock donations, approval of gifts (donations), and information on the General Charitable Aid Association. Other business related materials include activity reports, repairs to homes, design proposals, NRF work progress reports, and requests for interviews. While these materials are related to Doris Duke's business pursuits, the personal side of life is also reflected as the authors often comment on current events and other daily activities such as congratulations on her marriage to Porfirio Rubirosa.</p>
               
               <p>Materials related to the personal activities of Doris Duke include invitations to a variety of charitable events, solicitations for charitable contributions (letters addressed directly to Doris Duke and not her charitable organization often from individuals not personally acquainted with her), datebooks, address books, personal letters to friends (copies), magazine subscriptions, and correpondence related to travel. Of particular interest is correspondence (letters, telegrams) between Doris Duke and her mother Nanaline and between Doris Duke and her half-brother Walker Inman Sr. (Miss Duke signed her letters "Sis"), and two letters from Doris Duke while on her honeymoon in 1935.</p>
               
               <p>The materials are loosely arranged in chronological order. Note that the subseries contains several documents written in French and Italian with no translation.</p>
               
               <p>This series also contains electronic records related to a variety of administrative activities at the Duke Farms residence and includes monthly reports from managers, summaries of correspondence generated by the Duke Business Office staff, telephone messages, and lists of request for donations from the Doris Duke Foundation. The Duke Business Office arranged the electronic records in folders by both subject and by month and year.</p>

               <p>A majority of the correspondence in this series are written to Doris Duke by a variety of family, friends, and acquaintances. Materials include letters, telegrams, cards, notes, and postcards. Of particular interest are outgoing letters from Doris Duke to Marian Paschal while she was an International News Service (INS) correspondent during World War II. These letters give insight to Doris Duke's experiences while overseas.</p>
               
               <p>A majority of the series is arranged alphabetically by sender. The last box in the series contains general correspondence in which senders could not be identfied and/or letters that may or may not attest to a deeper relationship with Doris Duke. Note that the subseries contains letters written in French and Italian with very few translations.</p>

                  <p>This series illustrates the broad, diverse financial activities of Doris Duke, and covers a variety of personal and business related topics. Materials include letters to Doris Duke thanking her for generous donations (personal donations, not through her Foundation), estimates for Shangri La by the Hawaiian Contracting Company Ltd, invoices for furniture and other purchases at Parke-Bernet, personal expenses such as clothing, hair, repairs to residences, rental of a Lear Jet, and transportation of swans and camels from New Jersey to Newport (and the other way around). Also included in this series are Doris Duke's personal tax returns (with supporting documentation of donations given for the year, journal entries, and "work papers"), stock and bond advice, personal bank and credit card statements and annual reports on Doris Duke's net worth. Of particular interest is correspondence related to Doris Duke Cromwell's financial assistance to Miss Ruby Roney and Mildred Brett, distant Duke family members.</p>
                  
                  <p>The materials in this subseries are loosely arranged in chronological order.</p>

                  <p>This subseries primarily consists of inventory cards either in binders (books) or unbound and were maintained by the Duke Business Office staff, circa 1970s–1990s, to inventory and track the movement of objects on and between Doris Duke’s properties. These cards have been left in the original order they were found and presumably created in. For the most part, they are arranged by location and room thereunder, except as noted below. Also in this subseries are invoices (copies &amp; originals) from art and antique dealers documenting the purchase of art, furniture and other objects from the 1930s to the 1960s, and miscellenous correspondence and inventories from the various residences.</p>
                  
                  <p>Inventory books 1-47 are arranged by location and room thereunder. Books 48-59 have been arranged by medium and location thereunder. Unbound inventory cards have been kept in the original order they were found and presumably created in.  As such, they have been arranged by location and room thereunder. The unbound Shangri La inventory cards were not stored with the other inventory cards but were included in this subseries as they compliment the rest of the Shangri La inventory cards.</p>

                  <p>During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Animal Medical Center (AMC) had a research center on the Duke Farms estate to study the aging in large animals. Doris Duke not only provided grants to the Animal Medical Center (via the Doris Duke Foundation), but also leased pastures and barns on the property of Duke Farms for a cattle center. The relationship with the AMC ended in 1974. This materials in this subseries include annual reports, leases, and correspondence and memoranda related to various subject matters of the Animal Medical Center and its rental of land at Duke Farms.</p>

Doris Duke contributed a monthly sum to the association which often included a list of those individuals whom she felt were considered "worthy and deserving of assistance." The materials include correspondence such as charitable requests, charitable support and thank you letters from those receiving assistance, annual reports of contributions and donations, and an account book for all those receiving aid from the charitable association.</p>

                  <p>Doris Duke was the sole proprietor of LADD Interiors, a proprietorship with the purpose of purchasing home furnishings and some antique furniture and then transferring these goods to her for use in her own personal residence(s) or as she desired. The first purchase by LADD was in 1972, and with few exceptions all purchases by LADD were made in connection with refurbishing Doris Duke's residences at Duke Farms, Rough Point, Shangri La and her Park Avenue apartment. Materials in this subseries primarily consist of invoices and correspondence for these purchases and for the restoration of some furniture. Other materials include tax documentation, inventories (including color photographs), bank statements and fabric samples.</p>

                  <p>The materials in this subseries vary widely and serve to document general subjects related to Doris Duke that are not documented in the other subseries. It is the only subseries that includes materials from Doris Duke's childhood such as her school composition books, homework assignments, and glossy photographs/scrapbooks of magazine clippings of actors and actresses from the 1920s. Other materials included are notes and lyrics written by Doris Duke, original dress designs from the House of Paquin for Doris Duke, Playbills from shows attended by Doris Duke, and newspaper clippings organized by Doris Duke that were of interest to her. Inside these folders are the spines of the binders (paper) with her handwriting on how they were separated. Of interest is the "Me" binder (folder) which contains clippings about Doris Duke.</p>

                  <p>The correspondence in this subseries is general in nature primarily written by those who were not close, personal friends of Doris Duke. There are a variety of authors, including business associates, acquaintances and the general public, who wrote on a wide range of topics including birthday greetings, thank you letters/cards, requests for donations, invitations, requests for interviews and general correspondence. In addition, Box 378 contains letters, memoranda, notes, and business cards from either published authors or friends and acquaintances which accompanied books personally sent Doris Duke. The associated books, along with others without enclosed materials, have been separated from the Doris Duke Papers and catalogued as part of the Rubenstein Library's printed holdings.</p>

                  <p>Doris Duke was a well known lover of animals - owning and rescuing a variety of animals including dogs, birds, camels, horses, and a donkey - and the materials in this subseries document this aspect of her life. Materials include purchase of pets, wild animals that were cared for at the different estates, the care of different animals, vet bills and reports, and insurance for pets. Of particular interest are the materials associated with the purchase and care of two Bactrian camels, Baby and Princess, who resided at both the Rough Point and Duke Farms estates.</p>

                  <p>Doris Duke acquired the Lake Mashipacong property in 1938 and almost immediately leased the land to the Trail Blazer Camp, a camping facility for underpriviledged children. Miss Duke funded most of the original buildings and over the course of several decades, generously donated to the camp for its operations. The materials in this subseries document Doris Duke's role in the history, management, daily activities, and financial support of the camp. Materials include leases, annual reports, brochures, appraisals, certificates of insurance, and thank you letters to Doris Duke for her continuing generosity of the camp. Of particular interest is the correspondence from Anthony (Tony) Drexel Duke.</p>

                  <p>Walker P. Inman Jr. was the son of Walker P. Inman, Sr. (Doris Duke's step brother) and Georgia Inman.

The materials in this subseries primarily focus on this guardianship, and include correspondence, memoranda, and expenses related to Walker Jr.'s schooling and upbringing, financial statements related to his trusts, and legal documentation associated with the guardianship. Several of the folders related to Walker P. Inman Jr.'s emotional, mental, and educational progress are restricted.</p>

               <p>This series contains administrative, financial, legal, reports and summaries, and other materials as maintained by the Duke Business Office. Although these materials pertain mostly to Doris Duke and were acquired during her lifetime, some of them were acquired before and after her lifetime. Topics include materials relating to routine business matters, personal finances and accounts, travel, divorces from James Cromwell and Porfirio Rubirosa, inventories of all belongings, and deeds and titles to all properties owned. Of particular interest are Doris Duke's passports which illustrate the numerous places Doris Duke visited during her adult life.</p>
