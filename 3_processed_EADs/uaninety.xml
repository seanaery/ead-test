         <abstract>The Society of 9019, organized in February 1890 under the leadership of John Spencer Bassett, was an honorary scholarship fraternity.  The society began at Trinity College and continued on at Duke University.  Acceptance into the 9019 was based, in part, on an academic average of 90 or above.  It was also conditioned upon a scholastic average of 2.25 quality points, making it similar to the male only Phi Beta Kappa society.  The 9019 is credited with establishing the South Atlantic Quarterly, supporting scholarly activities among North Carolina high schools, and establishing student-faculty forums on a variety of timely subjects.  The group disbanded in the early 1940s.

 The 9019 records contain ritual and member lists, program and contest advertisements, ceremonial robes, founding documents, letters, photographs, memorabilia and other papers related to this honor society. The dates of the materials range from 1892-1944.</abstract>

            <p>The Society of the 9019 was the first honor society at Trinity College. In February of 1890, John Spencer Bassett founded the Society of the 9019 and became its first president. Bassett’s desire to arouse the intellectual and literary interests of students and to stimulate interest in the history of the South inspired him to create the 9019. The 9019 recognized the outstanding students of the college, encouraged its members to promote scholarship on campus and in the community, and fostered a "true college spirit." The origin of the name is a representation of a) the 90 percent average required for admittance and b) the number of original members. As a precursor to Phi Beta Kappa, the 9019 provided a unique opportunity for recognition and involvement in campus activities. Notable contributions include the creation of the South Atlantic Quarterly and supporting scholarly activities among North Carolina high schools via annual declamation contests. The 9019 continued operation throughout the transformation to Duke University, but competing fraternities and World War II brought an end to the organization.</p>
