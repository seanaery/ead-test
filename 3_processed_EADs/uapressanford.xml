         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>James Terry Sanford was born August 20, 1917 in
		  Laurinburg, N.C., the son of Cecil L. and Elizabeth Martin
		  Sanford. He received the A.B. degree (1939) and the JD
		  degree (1946) from the University of North Carolina at
		  Chapel Hill. After serving in the military and FBI and
		  while practicing law in Fayetteville, N.C., Sanford
		  embarked on a political career. He served as North Carolina
		  State Senator from 1953 to 1954 and as United States
		  Senator from 1986 to 1992. In 1961 he was elected Governor
		  of North Carolina and held the office through 1965.</p>
         
         <p>In December 1969 Sanford was elected President of
		  Duke University. He assumed the office in April 1970 and
		  held the position through June 1985. His involvement at
		  Duke continued as President Emeritus, from 1985 to 1998,
		  and as Professor of Public Policy, from 1992 to 1998. Terry
		  Sanford died on April 18, 1998 and is buried in the Crypt
		  in the Chapel at Duke University.</p>
         
         <p>Sanford married Margaret Rose Knight in 1942; they
		  had two children, Elizabeth Knight and Terry, Jr. </p>

                  <p>The Subject files document Sanford's role as
				  President of Duke, and also his continued interest in many
				  fields including education, politics, and the arts.</p>
                  
                  <p>The records of the Sanford administration
				  record the policies and actions of the University in
				  academic planning, athletics, campus planning and the
				  physical growth of the university, development and alumni
				  affairs, student life, and the University's interaction
				  with Durham and North Carolina during the 1970s and 1980s.
				  Among the more notable academic planning matters documented
				  are the early years of both the Fuqua School of Business
				  and the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs,
				  now the Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy. Also
				  included is correspondence from alumni, faculty, and
				  students against the administration's proposal in 1975 to
				  phase out the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
				  Correspondents in the area of academic planning include
				  Joel Fleishman, Director of the Institute of Policy
				  Sciences and Public Affairs; Thomas Keller, Dean of the
				  Fuqua School of Business; and John C. McKinney, Dean of the
				  Graduate School, and other officers.</p>
                  
                  <p>Folders pertaining to the
				  <emph render="doublequote">Retrenchment</emph> measures taken in
				  1980-1981 that eliminated the undergraduate Department of
				  Education and the baccalaureate program in Nursing are also
				  part of this series. These steps were recommended to the
				  Board of Trustees in September 1980 by then-Chancellor A.
				  Kenneth Pye in his memorandum, 
				<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Directions for
				  Progress.</title> The bulk of the material consists of
				letters and memoranda from Sanford to faculty and alumni of
				the departments announcing the actions and correspondence
				from alumni, educators, and school administrators
				expressing their support of or opposition to the plan.</p>
                  
                  <p>Continuing the fundraising efforts that
				  began with the Fifth Decade Campaign, 1964-1970,
				  <emph render="doublequote">Institutional Advancement</emph>
				  files focus primarily on the Epoch Campaign, a three-year
				  campaign that attempted to raise $162 million from
				  1973-1976. The material concerns the progress of the Epoch
				  Campaign and other fundraising efforts, such as the Loyalty
				  Fund, 1979-1980.</p>
                  
                  <p>Sanford's commitment to the arts can be seen
				  in the files on the <emph render="doublequote">American Musical
				  Theater Center, 1977-1980</emph> and the
				  <emph render="doublequote">American Dance Festival,
				  1977-1985.</emph> The recruitment and arrival of the
				  Festival at Duke in 1977 began a long relationship that has
				  continued for over 20 year.</p>
                  
                  <p>The records also document student life, but
				  to a lesser extent than other topics. Issues related to
				  student activism of the early 1970s are found within
				  <emph render="doublequote">Student Unrest</emph> files. These
				  records include clippings and a scrapbook documenting the
				  student takeover the Allen Building in February 1969,
				  before Sanford's presidency. Material from May 1970 largely
				  concerns student actions on campus in response to the Kent
				  State shootings. Letters of approval or disapproval from
				  alumni and student parents on these and other topics are
				  included as well. The records also document another aspect
				  of student life that Sanford faced: the use of illegal
				  drugs. In 1971 Sanford rejected a proposal from the
				  Associated Students of Duke University calling for a
				  relaxed stance by the administration on the use of drugs,
				  particularly marijuana.</p>
                  
                  <p>Student conduct at athletic events is also
				  documented. On January 17, 1984 <emph render="doublequote">Uncle
				  Terry</emph> Sanford sent <emph render="doublequote">An
				  Avuncular Letter</emph> to students chiding them for their
				  inappropriate behavior during a home basketball game with
				  the University of Maryland. The file contains the original
				  letter, many newspaper articles detailing the behavior,
				  letters to Sanford from concerned parents and alumni, and
				  Sanford's response to each.</p>
                  
                  <p>The major change in residential life during
				  Sanford's tenure was the 1972 merger of the Woman's College
				  with Trinity College for Men to create the present Trinity
				  College of Arts and Sciences. While the school had long
				  been co-educational, the merger completed the switch to
				  co-residency. Included are correspondence from alumni,
				  administrators, and other institutions regarding the pros
				  and cons of the merger. There is also some correspondence
				  regarding the future of the Woman's College
				  administrators.</p>
                  
                  <p>Sanford's interest in all levels of
				  education is found throughout the files as well. During the
				  1960s and 1970s he served on the Board of Directors of the
				  <emph render="doublequote">Learning Institute of North
				  Carolina</emph> (LINC), a non-profit agency dedicated to
				  improving education through experimentation and research.
				  The LINC records, dating from 1965-1979, consist of
				  correspondence, minutes, reports, and reference
				  material.</p>
                  
                  <p>The records also illustrate how national and
				  international issues played out on campus. Among these are
				  investment policies in South Africa, in which students,
				  faculty, and the administration began questioning Duke's
				  support of U.S. businesses with investments in South
				  Africa. Regarding the Panama Canal Treaty (1977-1978),
				  Sanford attempted to put together a panel debate with Jesse
				  Helms, Henry Kissinger, and others participating.
				  Correspondence is included with these two, President Jimmy
				  Carter, and others.</p>
                  
                  <p>Among the other major issues of the Sanford
				  administration were the <emph render="doublequote">Nixon Library
				  Controversy, 1981-1982,</emph> (3.5 boxes). These files
				  concern the debate over whether Duke should house Richard
				  Nixon's presidential library. Sanford argued in favor of

               <p>This series consists of administrative
				records, along with some personal papers. The bulk of
				material runs from 1992-1997 and consists of computer
				disks, correspondence, faxes, journals, mailing lists,
				memoranda, photographs, speeches, transcripts, website
				printouts, writings, clippings and other printed matter.
				The files are organized into subject files, correspondence
				(1990-1998), and writings.</p>
               
               <p>The records also include files on
				organizations to which Sanford belonged or boards on which
				he served. Included among these: Methodist College,
				Fayetteville, N.C. (Trustee); North Carolina Museum of Art
				(chaired Board of Trustees); Ovation, Inc. - a Fine Arts
				Network (Board of Directors); and the Sarah W. Stedman
				Center for Nutritional Studies (Board of Advisors). Some
				files continue and supplement material found in other
				series: American Dance Festival; Education Commission of
				the States; and Outward Bound.</p>
               
               <p>Files are included on courses Sanford taught
				within the Public Policy Studies Department at Duke from
				1993-1997, most notably a course titled "Creativity in
				State Government". Syllabi, handouts, lists of students,
				and some correspondence are included. These files contain
				student identifiable data, and are subject to federal
				privacy legislation.</p>
               
               <p>The records show Sanford's continued interest
				in and opinions on various issues, including political
				ones. Examples include the Nicaraguan Canal project,
				poverty, and racism. Within the Racism file is a 1997 memo
				from Sanford to John Hope Franklin, Professor Emeritus of
				History at Duke University and chair of President Clinton's
				National Advisory Panel on Race, outlining his plans to
				begin an association to help promote improved race
				relations. Sanford mentioned <emph render="doublequote">National
				Good Neighbor Council</emph> as a possible title.</p>
               
               <p>Sanford's day-to-day activities during the
				1990s are documented throughout these files. Folders
				labeled <emph render="doublequote">Journal</emph> contain
				loose-leaf paper with daily appointments and schedules
				detailing meetings, dinners, travel plans, and leisure
				activities. Often, Sanford would write notes on the
				particular meeting/event (wrote before and/or after). In
				1993 Sanford kept a bound journal for a week in February.
				Other files documenting Sanford's daily activities include
				folders of telephone messages and two rolodexes of
				addresses and business cards.</p>
               
               <p>Other significant records include Sanford's
				Cyber Bookstore project. This was intended to create a
				means of purchasing publications over the World Wide Web
				similar to the Amazon.com. There are also reports, drafts,
				and proposals from the Ethics Review Commission of the
				United States Senate, 1993-1994, and files on his support
				for the Airborne and Special Operations Museum project in
				Fayetteville, N.C.</p>
               
               <p>Correspondents include President Bill Clinton,
				to whom Sanford voiced his opinion or expressed his
				support; and Howard Covington, Sanford's biographer.
				Sanford sent Covington thoughts or remembrances that he
				felt should be included in the biography, or he would write
				in response to Covington's questions. Among the
				recollections include a detailed account of Sanford's
				decision to endorse John F. Kennedy's presidential
				campaign.</p>
               
               <p>Two of the three boxes of writings consist of
				hand-written and typed drafts, research notes, a synopsis,
				and bibliographical material for Sanford's unfinished
				historical novel, Top of the World. Sanford worked on the
				novel from 1994-1998 and drafts of the first six chapters
				at the time of his death are included. According to an
				article in the Raleigh News and Observer (Jan. 10, 1994,
				p.3-A), Sanford did not think it would be completed until
				the 21st century. The third box contains drafts, notes, and
				additional material on three Sanford manuscripts. They
				include the unfinished works 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Lasting Lyndon</title>
			 (1991) on the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, and 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Out of the Valley,</title>
			 (1975), surveying public policies; Sanford referred to the
			 latter work as "an autobiographical political platform".
			 The file also includes the manuscript of Outlive Your
			 Enemies: (Commack, N.Y.: Nova Sciences Publishers, 1996),
			 Sanford's study on aging and growing old gracefully.</p>
               
               <p>A final box labeled 
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Miscellaneous</title>
			 contains primarily Democratic Party-related material from
			 the 1980s and a note to incorporate them into the
			 records.</p>

                  <p>The personal and political papers of Terry
				  Sanford consist of correspondence, memoranda, manuscripts,
				  newspaper clippings, reference material, printed matter,
				  audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and a
				  scrapbook. The bulk were acquired from Sanford's house in
				  Durham, N.C., and he apparently kept them close by for
				  reference purposes for much of his career. Some folders
				  appear to have been removed from his records as Duke
				  President.</p>
                  
                  <p>The papers primarily contain the files of
				  organizations to which Sanford belonged or boards on which
				  he served. These included the Foreign Study League
				  (advisory council); Citizens Committee for Government
				  Reorganization (co-chairman); the National Council on Crime
				  and Delinquency (chaired N.C. Committee); the National
				  Municipal League/Citizens' Forum on Self Government
				  (multiple offices including President); the National Public
				  Affairs Center for Television (Board of Directors); the
				  National Recreation and Park Association; National Urban
				  League; Outward Bound; Shaw University (Trustee); the Soul
				  City project; Southern Regional Growth Board; Robert Taft
				  Institute of Government (Trustee); Children's Television
				  Workshop; and Urban America, Inc. (Trustee).</p>
                  
                  <p>Also included are records from Sanford's
				  political career and interests. Among these are records
				  from his tenure as N.C. Governor, including files on race
				  relations, reports, and correspondence; the 1960
				  Gubernatorial campaign; speeches and drafts; clippings and
				  printed material; surveys of political climate and polls;
				  the 1954 Senatorial Campaign (campaign manager for W. Kerr
				  Scott); his support of Fritz Hollings' 1983-1984
				  Presidential Nomination; and correspondence with the N.C.
				  Young Democrats, 1965-1968. Of particular note is a 1977
				  confidential memo that Sanford typed for his records
				  recounting President Carter's request that Sanford accept
				  the position of Ambassador to France. Other correspondents
				  include Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy.</p>

                  <p>Formed in 1966 as the Citizens Conference on
				  State Legislatures, the organization examined state
				  legislatures and prepared strategies to enhance their
				  effectiveness. Terry Sanford served on the Board of
				  Trustees in the late 1960s and later as an honorary Board
				  member. Initiated in 1976, the Library Project attempted to
				  develop a series of publications addressing the history and
				  operation of American State governments in order to raise
				  public interest in legislative reform. Sanford chaired the
				  project committee and was named editor-in-chief of the
				  series. Originally, Duke University Press was to play a
				  major role in the publication. The Library Project
				  struggled to get off the ground due to a number of factors
				  including decisions on authors and publication, and
				  financial concerns. The project folded in 1980 as Legis 50
				  filed for bankruptcy.</p>
                  
                  <p>Earlier material in these records,
				  1966-1975, consists of correspondence, memoranda, agendas,
				  minutes, and annual reports while Sanford served on the
				  Board of Trustees. Material from 1976-1980 concerns the
				  Library Project and includes grant proposals and
				  correspondence with Legis 50 staff and potential authors.
				  Also included is a memo for the record concerning the
				  content and importance of the files.</p>

				  proposals, printed matter, questionnaires, financial
				  material, films, audiocassettes, and audiotapes concerning
				  the Democratic Charter Commission, which Terry Sanford
				  chaired. The Commission was established by the 1972
				  Democratic Convention to draft a charter for the Democratic
				  Party, the first in the party's history. The Charter
				  established national structures and guidelines for the
				  party on issues such as leadership, membership, and
				  education. It was approved during the midterm convention of
				  December 1974 and went into effect in 1980.</p>
                  
                  <p>The records, though largely unorganized,
				  document Sanford and the Commission's efforts from
				  1972-1974. Includes folders on individual states, which
				  often contain lists of delegates and material on individual
				  state conferences or hearings (including agendas,
				  discussions, and summaries of proceedings) held to discuss
				  the proposed Charter. Sanford usually attended these state
				  conferences and delivered the opening and/or closing
				  remarks. Other material consists of Commission member
				  lists, questionnaires on party structure and charter
				  proposals, and Commission-related newspaper clippings. The
				  correspondence is not foldered together, but spread
				  throughout the records. Correspondents include President
				  Jimmy Carter, then Governor of Georgia; Robert Strauss,
				  Chairman of the Democratic National Committee; members of
				  the Commission; and Democratic members of Congress.</p>
                  
                  <p>Included among the approximately 20 original
				  reel to reel films and audiotapes and 20 audiocassettes are
				  session recordings from Commission conferences (in
				  Colorado, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas,
				  Washington D.C., and Wisconsin); and interviews with
				  members of the Commission for a proposed public relations
				  project in 1974 (not completed). Most films and cassettes
				  are labeled and in fair condition.</p>

               <p>The photographs and negatives span Sanford's
				career. Photographs are arranged and foldered by subject,
				though some subjects are vague (<emph render="doublequote">people</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">political</emph> for example). Others
				include: Duke University Activities, Functions; 1972
				Presidential Campaign; FBI; Gubernatorial Years; and
				University of North Carolina Law School. Among the
				individuals: Jimmy Carter, Andy Griffith, J. Edgar Hoover,
				Lyndon B. Johnson, John F. Kennedy, Soviet Premier Kosygin,
				Carl Sandburg, Strom Thurmond, Harry S. Truman, John Wayne,
				and Sanford's family and friends. For additional
				photographs see the general photograph collection in the
				Duke University Archives.</p>
               
               <p>The printed matter includes 
				newspaper articles written during his tenure as President
				of Duke University. A majority of the articles are from the
				Durham newspapers and the Duke student newspaper, The
				Chronicle. The articles are poorly organized, though hint
				at a chronological arrangement. The document box contains
				ready reference files, again focusing primarily on his
				tenure at Duke. This includes copies of speeches, clippings
				on his inauguration, and programs for a tribute ceremony to
				Sanford in 1985. Other files include the Democratic Charter
				Commission, U.S. Senate, and other political clippings.</p>
