         <p>Robert Stanley Rankin (1899-1976), educator and political scientist, was born in Tusculum,
		  TN, and educated at Tusculum College. He received graduate degrees at Princeton and returned to
		  Tusculum as a political science professor in 1924. His career at Duke began in 1927 as assistant
		  professor of political science. Rankin was appointed associate professor in 1929, professor in
		  1934, and was chairman of the political science department from 1949 to 1964. He was co-founder and
		  president (1931) of the Southern Political Science Association. Active in local and national
		  politics, he served on the Durham, NC City Council from 1955 to 1960. President Eisenhower
		  appointed him to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1960, where he served for 16 years. He
		  retired from teaching in 1969. The Robert S. Rankin Civil Rights Library at the U.S. Commission on
		  Civil Rights, established in 1960, was named for Rankin in 1976.</p>

               <p>The materials in this series appear to have been edited and rearranged by Rankin's
				wife, Dorothy Newsom Rankin. In many instances, there are interpretive notes written by Mrs. Rankin
				on the outsides of file folders. Some of the folder titles appear to be Rankin's original titles,
				while other titles and dates seem to have been provided by Mrs. Rankin. Some of the folders were
				unlabeled and have been given titles by University Archives staff. In some instances, no common
				subject for the materials in the folders could be ascertained, and those folders have not been
				supplied titles and remain unlabeled.</p>
               
               <p>There are extensive handwritten notes by Mrs. Rankin regarding these materials in the
				University Archives Collection File. Please consult a University Archives staff member to see these
				notes. </p>
