         <abstract>The Triangle Universities Computation Center (TUCC) was incorporated in 1965 as a cooperative venture between Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with the goal of providing main-frame computing services, such as electronic data and batch processing, to the universities, RTI International and others. It dissolved in 1990 due to financial difficulties, the increased use of personal computers, and disagreements among the partners.  Materials in the collection include administrative records, correspondence, meeting minutes, financial and statistical reports, memoranda, proposals, newsletters, photographs, slides, a scrapbook, and other materials from the Triangle Universities Computation Center. </abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Triangle Universities Computation Center (TUCC) was incorporated in 1965 as a cooperative venture between Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Owned by all three universities, its primary goals were to provide each institution with adequate computing facilities as economically as possible, minimizing the number of system programming personnel and fostering greater cooperation between the universities with an exchange of system programs and ideas. Housed in the Science and Technology Research Center in centrally located Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, TUCC eventually expanded its main-frame computer services beyond the three universities, to support the electronic data processing needs of RTI International and other research organization located in RTP.</p>
         
         <p>TUCC's decline began in the mid-1980s with an unsuccessful bid to purchase and operate a supercomputer in RTP, with the goal of transforming RTP into a "Southern Silicon Valley". This failed bid, coupled with increasing financial difficulties, the growing number of clients purchasing their own personal computers and thus needing fewer TUCC services, and escalating disagreements among member institutions about how the center should be run, ultimately lead to the dissolution of TUCC in September, 1990.</p>

               <p>Materials in the collection include photographs (both black and white and color), color slides, microfilm reels, a scrapbook and videotape documenting social functions and operational activities related to the Triangle Universities Computation Center. Of particular interest are the microfilm reels copied by Control Data Corporation (CDC) at TUCC as part of their discovery procedure relative to the anti-trust suit against IBM. Due to the fragile nature of the materials, items in Box 11 are located in off-site storage.</p>
