         <head>Historical Note</head>
         
         <p>The Women's Center serves the Duke undergraduate, graduate and professional student communities. The Center was established in January of 1989 and began offering programming in the fall of 1989 after a two and a half year process begun by a group of undergraduate women who called themselves "The Coalition for a Women's Center at Duke." The Coalition researched and published a report outlining the need for a Center whose sole purpose was to support and promote student women and gender issues on campus. A task force was appointed by the Vice President for Student Affairs and its charge was to further research the need for and explore the feasibility of a Women's Center at Duke. After being founded, the Women's Center expanded its services to include the Office of Sexual Assault Support Services (SASS) in the spring of 1991.</p>
         
         <p>The Women's Center is a department within the Division of Student Affairs and part of the Campus Life management team within the Division.  The Women's Center's Director reports to the Assistant Vice-President for Student Affairs. The Women's Center's budget comes from the Division of Student Affairs. The SASS budget comes from Student Health fees. The Women's Center is currently (2008) staffed by 5 professional staff members: a Director, a Program Coordinator, an Office Manager, the Coordinator of Sexual Assault Support Services, and an Assistant Coordinator of Sexual Assault Support Services. Directors include: Martha Stewart, 1989-1993; Ellen Plummer, 1993-1998; Donna Lisker, 1999-2007; and Ada Gregory.</p>
