         <abstract>Collection includes correspondence separated into two
				subseries: "Letters To or About Walt Whitman," and "Letters From or By Walt
				Whitman." Most of Whitman's letters in the collection were written between 1880 and
				1891. Letters include those written to and from friends, family members, editors,
				publishers, and soldiers Whitman met in and around Washington, D. C. during the
				Civil War. The Clippings Series includes both large groups of clippings collected
				and annotated by Whitman, and clippings Whitman took from complete or nearly
				complete articles. Also included are manuscripts and printed materials about or
				relating to Whitman, most of which date between the late nineteenth century and the
				end of World War II. There are portraits, etchings, engravings, and sketches both of
				Whitman and of other subjects. A Writings Series contains manuscript and printed
				versions of poetry and prose dating from Whitman's career in journalism up through
				the mid-1940s. It is divided into seven subseries: Manuscript Poems (1855-1882 and
				n.d.); Manuscript Prose (1852-1891 and n.d.); Proofs (1874-1891 and n.d.); Poems Set
				to Music (1901-1933); Books and Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman
				(1841-1924); Editions of Whitman's Writings (1855-1944); and Bibliographies and
				Catalogs (1922-1943).</abstract>

            <p>The bulk of Duke University's Walt Whitman holdings were acquired through a
					series of substantial donations made by Dr. and Mrs. Josiah C. Trent, from whom
					the Trent Collection of Whitmaniana takes its name. Much of the Trent material
					was originally gathered by Richard Maurice Bucke, Whitman's friend and literary
					executor, who sold manuscript versions of his biography of Whitman, along with
					his collection of unpublished letters and Whitman's personal papers and books,
					in London in 1935. The next year, Jacob Schwartz offered for sale in New York a
					large portion of the Whitman holdings that had belonged to Bucke, and many of
					the items listed in the catalogue of this sale were a part of the original
					donation made to Duke by Dr. and Mrs. Trent in 1942. The Trent family made
					several important additions to their initial bequest in the years following the
					establishment of the collection, but Duke University does not expect its Whitman
					manuscript holdings to expand at any time in the near future.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Trent Collection of Whitmaniana</emph> incorporates material
				spanning the dates 1841-1947, with the bulk of the material dating from 1845-1849,
				1854-1857, and 1864-1892. The virtual reorganization of the collection, based upon
				that devised by Ellen F. Frey in <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Bibliography of Walt Whitman</title> (Port Washington, NY:
				Kennikat Press, 1945), divides it into six series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="bold">Writings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Material About or Relating to
					Whitman</emph>, <emph render="bold">Portraits</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph>.</p>
         
         <p/>
         
         <p>
            
            <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is separated into two subseries: "Letters
				To or About Walt Whitman," and "Letters From or By Walt Whitman." Most of Whitman's
				letters in the collection were written between 1880 and 1891. The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> lists both large groups of clippings
				collected and annotated by Whitman, and clippings Whitman took from complete or
				nearly complete articles. Whenever possible, these have been dated according to the
				periodical in which the articles originally appeared. <emph render="bold">Material
					About or Relating to Whitman</emph> is comprised of four subseries that catalog
				manuscript versions of Richard Maurice Bucke's biography of
				Whitman, other manuscript material written mostly by Whitman's friends, and books,
				pamphlets, and periodicals about Whitman's life and work, most of which date between
				the late nineteenth century and the end of World War II. The <emph render="bold">Portraits Series</emph> includes formal photographic and painted portraits,
				etchings, engravings, and sketches, both of Whitman and of other subjects, including
					George Sand, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
				and Whitman's brother George. The <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph> consists of
				ephemera related to Whitman's life and career as a poet. Two scrapbooks, a leaflet
				of receipts, book wrappers for the first edition of <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of Grass,</title> and documents relating to the Whitman
				fund are listed among this series' eclectic contents.</p>
         
         <p>By far the largest series in the collection, the <emph render="bold">Writings
					Series</emph> contains manuscript and printed versions of poetry and prose
				dating from Whitman's career in journalism up through the mid-1940s. It is divided
				into seven subseries: Manuscript Poems (1855-1882 and undated); Manuscript Prose
				(1852-1891 and undated); Proofs (1874-1891 and undated); Poems Set to Music
				(1901-1933); Books and Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman (1841-1924);
				Editions of Whitman's Writings (1855-1944); and Bibliographies and Catalogs
				(1922-1943). The first subseries, "Manuscript Poems," is further subdivided into
				categories intended to define three separate levels of poetic composition:
				manuscript versions of poems that appear in at least one edition of Leaves of Grass,
				manuscript versions of poems not published in Leaves of Grass, and verse fragments
				and outlines. The researcher is advised to consult the NYU <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Collected Writings of Walt Whitman,</title> particularly Harold
				W. Blodgett and Sculley Bradley, eds., <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of Grass: A Comprehensive Reader's Edition</title> (New York: NYUP,
				1965), pp. 585-706, for publication of previously uncollected material. Although
				older, Oscar Lovell Triggs, ed., <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of
					Grass</title> by Walt Whitman, vol. 3 of 10 (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons,
				1902) and Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, eds., <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Faint Clews and Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and
					His Family</title> (Durham, NC: Duke UP, 1949) are also helpful, the former
				particularly when used alongside Frey's Bibliography.</p>
         
         <p>The Manuscript Prose Subseries in the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> is
				further divided into seven categories. The first three are comprised of manuscript
				versions of stories, prefaces, and essays and lectures, respectively. Four less
				distinct subheadings follow. "Notes on Literature" represents an almost exact
				transliteration of Frey's category of the same name, however it should be noted that
				this category does not, at the time of writing, list all of Trent's holdings in
				Whitman's literary-critical manuscripts. Some literary criticism is contained in
				"Autobiographical Manuscripts" and "Whitman on His Own Writings," along with more
				purely impressionistic self-reflection. "Miscellany" should also be consulted, as it
				brings together in an unsystematic way Whitman's notes on travel, reading, and
				education as well as a scattering of notes on poetry and different forms of literary
				production.</p>
         
         <p>The last five subseries of the <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> bring
				together various published versions of Whitman's writing. Annotated proofs of his
				poetry and prose are identified in the finding aid, and cross-references are
				included between the Proofs Subseries and the Books and Periodicals Containing
				Contributions by Whitman Subseries in instances where the Trent Collection lists
				both a proof and a published version of a poem or article among its headings. The
				Books and Periodicals Containing Contributions by Whitman Subseries and the
				Bibliographies and Catalogs Subseries are nearly comprehensive surveys of pre-World
				War II editions of Whitman's writing and of Whitman bibliographies. The Poems Set to
				Music Subseries catalogs a number of Whitman's poems that were given musical
				settings, mostly in the first two decades of the twentieth century. See Bella C.
				Landauer, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of Music by Walt
					Whitman</title>, call number Trent I-9, for full bibliographic information on
				these pieces.</p>
         
         <p>Many published works by and about Walt Whitman and housed in the David M. Rubenstein
				Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library have been cataloged individually. These can be
				found by searching the Duke online catalog.</p>

						well as proofs and published versions of his work from his early career in
						journalism up through the end of his life. The categorization of the
						manuscript material is necessarily inexact, and it is recommended that the
						researcher consult Ellen F. Frey's <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">A Bibliography of Walt Whitman, Being
							a Catalog of the Trent Collection of Duke University,</title> for
						detailed descriptions of the manuscript fragments. A copy of Frey's
						Bibliography is available from the reference staff upon request. The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph> also contains published versions of
						certain of Whitman's poems that were set to music by several different
						composers. For a comprehensive guide to these works, see Frey or see Bella
						C. Landauer, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Leaves of Music by

							themselves. A mark of "P" next to a date indicates that the proof in
							question has been dated according to the periodical in which it
							appeared; a mark of "A," conversely, indicates that the proof has been
							dated by annotation. Where possible, the titles of the periodicals that
							published finalized versions of Whitman's articles and poems have been
							included. Listed alphabetically by title or periodical.</p>

						subject of Whitman's homosexuality includes transcriptions of letters from
						Perry and other contemporary Whitman scholars. Also included are several
						photographs of Whitman's house and additional portraits from <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Whitman Portraits</title>, edited by
