         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         <p>The primary correspondent in this collection is Charles Wilkes
		  (1798-1877), naval officer and explorer, who was a collateral descendant of
		  John Wilkes (1727-1797), the noted English politician. Charles Wilkes was born
		  in New York City, the son of John De Ponthieu and Mary (Seton) Wilkes. From
		  1815 through 1817 Wilkes was in the merchant service on board several ships
		  until he was appointed midshipman in the U. S. Navy on Jan. 1, 1818. His naval
		  career was destined to be a rather distinguished, yet controversial one. During
		  the next fifteen years he served on board several ships including the
		  <emph render="italic">Franklin</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Waterwitch,</emph> was promoted to lieutenant in 1826, and
		  surveyed the Narragansett Bay in 1832-1833. Wilkes's scientific achievements
		  were rewarded by his appointment to take charge of the Depot of Charts and
		  Instruments in Washington, D. C. in 1833. In 1837 and 1838 he was involved in
		  further surveying work at the shoals of Georges Bank and the Savannah
		  River.</p>
         
         <p>In 1838 Secretary of War Poinsett ordered Wilkes to command the South
		  Seas Surveying and Exploring Expedition. This expedition and the publications
		  concerning it provided the primary focus for his career until 1861. This
		  Exploring Expedition, which was absent from the United States from 1838 to
		  1842, had as its chief fields of exploration the islands of the Pacific Ocean,
		  the coast of the Antarctic Continent, and the American Northwest coast. From
		  1843 to 1861, Wilkes was assigned to special duty, chiefly to be in charge of
		  the Exploring Expedition collections and reports. In 1844 his 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Narrative of the United States
		  Exploring Expedition</title> was published, and scientific volumes appeared
		from time to time. In 1842 Wilkes had been tried by a court-martial and
		sentenced to be publicly reprimanded for illegally punishing some of his men.
		Despite this he was promoted to commander in 1843 and to captain in 1855.</p>
         
         <p>During the Civil War Charles Wilkes took the controversial step of
		  overhauling the British mail steamer <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> and
		  removed by force the Confederate commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, He
		  saw other service in a variety of commands and received promotion to commodore
		  and then to acting rear admiral in 1862. Again in 1864 Wilkes was
		  court-martialed and found guilty. Two years later he was promoted to rear
		  admiral on the retired list and was placed on special duty for a part of
		  1870-1873, After the Civil War he purchased the iron works at High Shoals, N.
		  C. and pursued business interests there for several years.</p>
         
         <p>Wilkes was married twice: first to Jane Jeffrey Renwick, sister of
		  James Renwick (1792-1863) in 1826, and then to Msry H. (Lynch) Bolton in 1854,
		  after the death of his first wife, He had six children from these marriages,

		  Charles Wilkes. U. S. Navy, 1798-1877</title> (Washington, 1978);

		Daniel Henderson (New York, 1953); and other sources listed in the Information
		Folder in box 1 of the collection,</p>
         
         <p>John (''Jack'') Wilkes (1827-1908), sailor and businessman, was the
		  son of Charles Wilkes as well as a correspondent in this collection.
		  Immediately after his appointment as a midshipman on September 9, 1841, young
		  Wilkes was sent to sea. He served on the <emph render="italic">Delaware</emph>
		  and on the <emph render="italic">Mississippi</emph> in the Gulf Squadron during
		  the Mexican War. His appointment to the U. S. Naval Academy came in 1846. After
		  graduation he was assigned to duty on the <emph render="italic">Albany</emph>
		  and on the <emph render="italic">Marion.</emph> In about 1848 his father had
		  him transferred for a time to work on the charts and calculations of the
		  Exploring Expedition. On Nov. 3, 1854, he resigned his commission.</p>
         
         <p>John Wilkes settled in Charlotte, N. C. in December, 1853, probably
		  during a leave of absence from the U. S. Navy. He moved to North Carolina to
		  supervise certain mining and milling property but in 1858 purchased the
		  Mecklenburg Flour Mills The next year he became the proprietor of what would
		  eventually be titled the Mecklenburg Iron Works. During the Civil War Wilkes
		  took an active role in the Southern effort through his service in the local
		  vigilance committee and the Home Guards, and as a financial advisor to North
		  Carolina state officials. Wilkes also became a railroad contractor in
		  government service.</p>
         
         <p>In August, 1869 Wilkes obtained a charter for the First National Bank
		  of Charlotte and served as its first president until 1869. This bank had the
		  distinction of being the first national bank established south of Richmond.
		  Wilkes formed a business partnership in the Rock Island Woolen Mills, but after
		  its failure he devoted his energy to the successful Mecklenburg Iron Works.</p>
         
         <p>Wilkes married Jane Renwick Smedberg of New York in April, 1854. Mrs
		  Wilkes became a prominent Charlotte philanthropist. The couple had nine
		  children, five of whom died at a young age. For further biographical

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The largest section in this collection is the correspondence,
		  1816-1876. It covers such subjects as the naval cruises of Charles Wilkes and
		  his son, John; the Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842, in terms of preliminary
		  planning, the voyage itself and detailed descriptions of places visited, and
		  publishing the results of the expedition; gold mining and milling in North
		  Carolina; the Civil War; and Wilkes family business ventures in North Carolina.
		  There are many letters written by prominent persons, including a particularly
		  rich section containing letters of scientists in 1848 and 1849. Also there is a
		  lengthy series of James Renwick (1792-1863) and Charles Wilkes correspondence.
		  Other groups of papers are the clippings, financial papers, legal papers,
		  miscellany, printed material, writings, and volumes.</p>
         
         <p>The correspondence covers a sixty-year span, 1816-1876, with the
		  majority of the letters being addressed to Charles Wilkes. The letters commence
		  with one from John Wilkes about obtaining a warrant as a midshipman for his son
		  Charles. Most of the early letters to 1818 are those of John to Charles
		  concerning the son's early naval career and the father's advice pertaining to
		  it.</p>
         
         <p>In the 1820s begin letters from Charles Wilkes while on naval voyages,
		  1822-1823, describing Rio de Janeiro; Valparaiso; and the earthquake, burial
		  customs, and clothing in Peru. The bulk of the letters for this period fall in
		  1825, while Wilkes was in Washington, D. C., waiting to take a naval
		  examination for promotion to lieutenant. His letters concern social occasions,
		  visiting friends, and prominent personages, including President and Mrs. John
		  Quincy Adams and a dinner they gave, Mrs. Calhoun, and Prince Achille Napoleon
		  Murat. Wilkes evidently made a conscious effort to contact and get to know the
		  <emph render="doublequote">right</emph> people, pertly to further his career.
		  Other Wilkes letters refer to the court-martial of Commodore Charles Stewart,
		  at which Wilkes was called to testify; two French generals in Washington,
		  Generals Lafayette and Simon Bernard; and steamboat and stagecoach travel.</p>
         
         <p>Letters to Wilkes in 1825 and 1826 relate news about the trade
		  situation in Chile, Simon Bolivar, politics and government in Peru, and U. S.
		  Navy commissions. A lengthy series of James Renwick (1792-1863) letters begins
		  in 1828 and continues to 1854. Renwick was an engineer and educator, professor
		  of natural philosophy and chemistry at Columbia, and an authority in every
		  branch of engineering of his day. The letters, which were written primarily to
		  Wilkes and to Jane Wilkes, Renwick's sister, relate to scientific and family
		  matters Letters of Renwick's sons, Henry and Edward, eminent engineers, and
		  James (1818-1895), a noted architect also appear in the papers.</p>
         
         <p>In 1828 and 1829 letters begin in reference to preliminary plans for
		  an exploring expedition. Particularly, Captain Thomas Ap Catesby Jones wrote a
		  lengthy letter on Jan. 2, 1829, about the proposed expedition. President
		  Jackson had given him command of the exploring squadron but later eased him out
		  of command. On May 7 Wilkes wrote to Secretary of Navy John Branch about
		  instruments and charts for the planned expedition.</p>
         
         <p>In the 1820s there begin series of letters among Wilkes family members
		  that continue in varying degrees throughout the collection. Those included in
		  addition to Charles are his brothers John ("Jack''), who resided on a
		  plantation outside Charleston; Henry, a lawyer in New York; and Edmund, also a
		  lawyer in New York; and a sister Eliza (Wilkes) Henry in Albany, N. Y. There is
		  an extended correspondence between Charles and his wife Jane, which runs from
		  1825 to 1848.</p>
         
         <p>From July, 1830, to May, 1831, Charles Wilkes was on an extended
		  Mediterranean cruise. As a result the collection for this period contains many
		  lengthy letters he wrote to his wife that are replete with detailed
		  descriptions of such locations as Gibraltar, Port Mahon, Algiers, Tunis,
		  Naples, Florence, and Marseilles. In particular there is an expecially good
		  account in September, 1830, of a visit Wilkes made to meet the Bey of Tunis and
		  the prime minister at the palace. Also there is information about the French
		  expedition to Algiers and the reaction to the French troops. Wilkes also
		  demonstrated his interest in cultural and social life through his careful
		  descriptions in Oct., 1830, of the National Museum, the San Carlo Opera, and
		  churches in Naples. He also participated in much social life while visiting
		  France in Dec., 1830.</p>
         
         <p>The letters for 1832 and 1833 fill only a portion of one folder. Of
		  note is a letter, July 28, 1833, by Charles Wilkes's brother John about the
		  South Carolina militia, states rights, Governor Hayne, and politics in South
		  Carolina</p>
         
         <p>A long series of letters from Henry Wilkes in New York to his brother
		  Charles in Washington, D C., appears from 1834 through the 1840s. The topics
		  are primarily business and financial matters, sale and management of property,
		  rental houses, and the Jackson City Association. Henry also wrote concerning
		  elections in New York, riots there, and his attitude toward blacks. Of
		  additional interest are letters in Dec., 1834, one that Charles Wilkes wrote to
		  Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson about measurements of the eclipse, and
		  one from James Renwick to Wilkes in reference to the U. S. Coast Survey.</p>
         
         <p>By mid-1836, some correspondence begins to appear concerning
		  preparations for the coming Exploring Expedition. For example, Wilkes wrote to
		  John Boyle, Acting Secretary of the Navy, in July about instruments he needed
		  for the voyage and requesting funds to purchase charts, books, and instruments.
		  In August Wilkes journeyed to England and Europe to obtain scientific
		  instruments for the expedition. In 1837 he wrote to Navy Secretary Dickerson
		  about his dealings with Edward John Dent, a chronometer maker in London, and
		  later about the disposition of instruments purchased for the expedition. Other
		  letters in 1838 discuss the organization of the expedition, who will command
		  it, speculation as to whether or not Wilkes will go, and plans and preparations
		  for staffing and equipment. On June 3, 1838, Mary Somerville, an English
		  scientific writer and astronomer, wrote to Wilkec about various aspects of
		  oceanography which were still possible topics for inquiry on an exploring
		  expedition. In the last half of 1837 are letters about Wilkes's surveying
		  efforts and a report by Mrs. Wilkes on a visit from Dolley Madison.</p>
         
         <p>From August, 1838, to June, 1842, Charles Wilkes was the commander of
		  the U. S. Exploring Expedition. Writing from the U. S. Ship
		  <emph render="italic">Vincennes</emph> to his wife, his letters are generally
		  lengthy and marvelously detailed. Although little information is included about
		  the specifics of the scientific experiments and specimen gathering, there is a
		  wealth of information about the people and places visited. It is possible to
		  include in this sketch only the highlights of information in the letters.
		  Please consult the subjects listed in this Guide for further information. In
		  1838 and 1839, the voyagers went to Madeira; Brazil; Valparaiso, Chile; Callao,
		  Peru; the Society Islands; and Sydney, Australia. Included is information about
		  the homes, plants, and wine-making in Madeira; the President of Chile; travels
		  to various small islands in the Pacific Ocean; natives; and social occasions.
		  Also Wilkes referred to discipline problems on board ship, the officers in the
		  squadron, the spirit of overall harmony on the expedition, and an apparent lack
		  of support for the expedition by the U. S. government.</p>
         
         <p>In 1840, Wilkes noted his sighting of the Antarctic Continent and then
		  the trip to the Fiji Islands. This latter stop was particularly poignant for
		  Wilkes because his nephew, Wilkes Henry, and a Lt. Underwood were murdered by
		  natives who sometimes practiced cannibalism. The voyage was marred by several
		  personnel problems. Wilkes suspended and sent home Dr. Gilchrist, a surgeon
		  assigned to the expedition, and had difficulties with Joseph P. Couthuoy, a
		  member of the scientific corps whom Wilkes dismissed. Wilkes's use of strict
		  discipline was to result later in a court-martial.</p>
         
         <p>In late 1840 and early 1841, the ships were docked in the Sandwich
		  Islands (Hawaii), where he wrote a detailed account of an adventurous trip to
		  explore the volcanic mountain, Mauna Loa, and of missionaries in Hawaii, In
		  May, 1841, he noted a stop in Oregon and the Columbia River.</p>
         
         <p>Letters in 1842 concern Wilkes's promotion and court-martial. His name
		  was omitted from the list of promotions in the Navy, and he was not promoted to
		  commander until 1843. The court-martial charges were primarily the result of
		  his supposed use of harsh discipline on the expedition. As mentioned previously
		  he was sentenced to be publicly reprimanded.</p>
         
         <p>There begins in the late 1830s and 1840s correspondence between
		  Charles Wilkes and his children, and among the children, which will continue
		  throughout the collection. The children with whom he communicated were John
		  (<emph render="doublequote">Jack</emph>) (1827-1908); Jane (1829-[18--?]);
		  Edmund (1833-[18--?]), an engineer; and Eliza (1838-[18--?]). Other family
		  letters include several from Anne de Ponthieu to her cousin Charles Wilkes in
		  the 1830s, and a long series between Henry Wilkes and his sister-in-law Jane
		  Wilkes in the 1840s.</p>
         
         <p>The family correspondence for the remainder of the 1840s during the
		  post Exploring Expedition period includes many letters of Henry Wilkes, brother
		  of Charles, particularly in 1846 and 1847. They concern business and financial
		  matters, coal property in Pennsylvania, and the sale of the Jackson City
		  property.</p>
         
         <p>During this period John Wilkes (1827-1908) wrote from the U.S.S.
		  <emph render="italic">Mississippi,</emph> which was on a cruise to Pensacola,
		  Vera Cruz, and other ports. Contained in his letters is a brief report of
		  Slidell's mission to Mexico, Several of his letters are from Annapolis where
		  John was a midshipman at the U. S. Naval Academy in early 1847. The others were
		  written from the U. S. S. <emph render="italic">Albany,</emph> which he was on
		  board for a surveying cruise to Mexico and the western coasts of Central and
		  South America. While on the cruise in late 1847 and 1848, he wrote to his
		  father descriptions of various stopping places such as the Island of St.
		  Thomas, Curaçao, and Caracas, Venezuela. In 1848 John was appointed Acting
		  Master of the <emph render="italic">Albany.</emph> The next year John's letters
		  to his father consist of those he wrote while on board the U. S. S.
		  <emph render="italic">Marion,</emph> and while attached to his father's
		  Exploring Expedition publication work for which he traveled to Philadelphia,
		  New York, and Washington, D. C.</p>
         
         <p>John's younger brother, Edmund, wrote several letters to his family
		  while he was in school in Philadelphia in 1846 to 1847. The bulk of his letters
		  during this period, though, date from August, 1848, through 1849, from
		  Charlotte, N. C. As a teenager, Edmund was given the responsibility of going to
		  Charlotte to oversee some mining and milling property there. This extensive
		  correspondence consists basically of reports by Edmund to his father and
		  instructions from Charles to his son; as a consequence, much information is
		  revealed about mining and milling efforts in the Charlotte area at this time.
		  Specifically Edmund gave accounts of grinding ore at the Charlotte and Capps
		  Mines, Capps Mine preparations, comments about amalgamation problems, milling
		  ore, and working stamp, grist, and saw mills at St. Catherine's Mills Charles
		  Wilkes owned at least a one-quarter share of the Capps Gold Mine, and also had
		  a share in a co-partnership for the mine called the Capps Company. It was his
		  intention to obtain possession of the engine at the Capps Mine and to provide
		  facilities for others to use it either for shares or by a tribute system. He
		  also wished to make St. Catherine's Mills a business place for grinding all
		  sorts of ores, but none of his ventures in Charlotte was ever very successful
		  or profitable.</p>
         
         <p>In the summer of 1848 Jane Wilkes, the wife of Charles, took a
		  vacation in Newport, Rhode Island, a fashionable summer resort area. Her
		  letters in July describe the people and activities there. Mrs. Wilkes had
		  suffered a leg injury in June, which worsened over the summer. She died in
		  August in Newport while her husband was on a trip to South Carolina and also to
		  Charlotte to inspect family property.</p>
         
         <p>As previously noted there is a series of James Renwick (1792-1863)
		  letters in this collection. The correspondence is particularly heavy for the
		  1843 to 1849 period. The letters concern reviewing of the manuscript of the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Narrative of the United States
		  Exploring Expedition</title> and his calculations made from measurements made
		during magnetic observations on the expedition. Renwick also wrote about his
		attempt to be appointed to the U. S. Boundary Commission, which failed, and the
		beginning careers of his three cons.</p>
         
         <p>The period, 1848 to 1849, is an especially rich one for this
		  collection in terms of the correspondence of prominent persons it contains.
		  From 1843 to 1861, Charles Wilkes was assigned to special service, chiefly in
		  Washington, D, C., preparing for publication and publishing the information
		  collected on the Exploring Expedition. Much of his correspondence during 1848
		  to 1849 deals with describing and cataloging the specimens, such as lichens,
		  collected on the expedition; work on preparing charts; writing, editing, and
		  publishing of volumes; and paying the bills for this work.</p>
         
         <p>In the course of this work Wilkes received letters from many prominent
		  scientists, naval officers, senators and congressmen, and statesmen. Please
		  consult the <emph render="doublequote">List of Selected Persons</emph> in this
		  Guide for an extensive listing of correspondents. Of particular interest are
		  four series of letters: 1. Asa Gray, botanist, to Wilkes from 1849 to 1859,
		  writing about work on the botany of the Exploring Expedition; 2. Jean Louis
		  Rodolphe Agassiz, zoologist, corresponding to Wilkes from 1849 to 1861,
		  concerning drawings of fish and echinoderm specimens from the expedition; 3.
		  Joseph Henry, scientist and first director of the Smithsonian Institution,
		  writing, 1849 to 1875, about loans of Exploring Expedition specimens; and 4.
		  John R. Bartlett (1805-1886), state official and bibliographer, writing in 1849
		  about the sales of the 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Narrative</title> and the
		publication of a spurious abridgment of the work. Other scientists who
		corresponded include Isaac Lea, James D. Dana (1813-1895), William D.
		Brackenridge, Titian Ramsay Peale, William S. Sullivant, and Edward
		Tuckerman.</p>
         
         <p>The correspondence for the 1850s continues two important themes of the
		  collection: the continuing work concerning the Exploring Expedition, and gold
		  mining and milling in North Carolina. Throughout, there are letters referring
		  to various aspects of the Exploring Expedition work, such as descriptions being
		  made of specimens, appropriations and bills, as well as letters from many
		  prominent scientists. Examples of such letters are Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz
		  writing about the classification and drawings of fish specimens, Asa Gray about
		  his work describing the botany of the expedition and William Sullivant's
		  drawings of mosses, Spencer F. Baird about his report on the reptiles, William
		  Sullivant about the engraving of drawings and publication of his work on
		  mosses, and Charles Pickering about his report on the geographical distribution
		  of plants and animals.</p>
         
         <p>Many other prominent persons who were not scientists also corresponded
		  with Wilkes during the 1850s, Of interest is a letter dated April 9, 1851, from
		  President Millard Fillmore to Wilkes thanking him for sending a copy of his
		  work on meteorology.</p>
         
         <p>A very long series of letters between Charles Wilkes and his younger
		  son Edmund continues from the 1840s through the 1850s, Most of the early
		  letters concern the mills at St, Catherine's Mills near Charlotte, N. C.;
		  financial matters; and the fact that the mills are not proving to be a very
		  successful venture, In the summer of 1850, Edmund returned home and then in
		  September began attending the Laurence Scientific School at Harvard to train to
		  be an engineer, The remainder of his letters for this period primarily concern
		  his work as an engineer on railroads in Ohio, particularly in Zanesville. His
		  letters describe hits work, operations of the Central Ohio Railroad, and the
		  many accidents on this railroad in 1858.</p>
         
         <p>The very long series of letters from John to his father Charles Wilkes
		  continues in 1850 until 1852 while John is on board the U.S.S.
		  <emph render="italic">Marion</emph> on a cruise continuing to places such as
		  Rio de Janeiro, China, and Manila Bay. He wrote very lengthy descriptive
		  letters on this cruise. In the summer of 1852 he was working on the
		  calculations for observations of the Exploring Expedition and also corresponded
		  while on trips to Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>
         
         <p>The remainder of the correspondence of John Wilkes as well as that of
		  some others pertains to mining and milling operations in the Charlotte area. In
		  1853 John went to North Carolina to be superintendent of the Capps mining
		  operations and presumably to continue work begun by his brother Edmund earlier.
		  John wrote about the condition of various mines, such as the Capps, McGinn, and
		  Dunn mines; mining operations, such as pumping water out of the Capps mine
		  shaft; his brief tenure as agent of the Capps Mining Company; problems with the
		  Capps Company; and continual financial problems. By August, 1855, the Capps
		  Mine was defunct. Charles Wilkes had been President of the St. Catherine's
		  Mining Company. John also became involved in milling operations and sent back
		  reports about the work, progress, and machinery repairs at the St. Catherine's
		  Mills; stamp mills; flour and corn milling; and questions about Wilkes's
		  ownership of St. Catherine's Mills. In 1858 John turned his attention to the
		  Mecklenburg Flour Mills, which he purchased with William R. Myers. Other
		  correspondence concerns a proposed St. Catherine Gold Mining Company, which
		  would have been formed to sell a newly invented machine for reducing metallic
		  ores.</p>
         
         <p>There is considerably less bulk for the 1860s and 1870s than for
		  earlier years, there being one box of material for each of these decades.
		  Certain letters in 1860 begin to mention the possibility of secession.
		  Throughout the Civil War period are references to various battles, ships, naval
		  and army officers, and views on the war. On November 8, 1861, Charles Wilkes
		  commanded that the British mail steamer <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> halt
		  and be boarded. He then searched the vessel, arrested the Confederate
		  commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, and removed them to the U.S. Ship
		  <emph render="italic">San Jacinto.</emph> Wilkes's primary error was in
		  searching a neutral vessel and seizing the agents on board, rather than
		  bringing the ship into port. His actions became quite controversial both in the
		  United States and in Europe. Although the British people were outraged by the
		  events, a majority of Lincoln's cabinet applauded the act. The matter was
		  finally resolved, though, when Secretary of State Seward released the
		  prisoners, realizing that the alternative was war with England. Two letters in
		  1862, written by Michele Costi, a publicist living in Venice, address this
		  affair. He wrote a strong defense of Wilkes's actions in the
		  <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> affair. A copy of Costi's, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">In difesa del San
		  Giacinto,</title> is contained in the writings. There is no firsthand account
		by Wilkes of this affair in the collection.</p>
         
         <p>In July and August, 1862, there is a series of letters from Secretary
		  of the Navy Gideon Welles to Charles Wilkes, who was co landing the James River
		  Flotilla at that time. Also in 1862 are various orders about ships, crews, and
		  discharges, as well as letters concerning aspects of the U. S. Navy, such as
		  health, medical care, surgeons, liquor, and deserters. Many of the letters in
		  1862 and 1863 comment on General George Brinton McClellan, particularly after
		  his removal as commander-in-chief of the U. S. Army; the Wilkes family favored
		  him. In late 1862 and early 1863 letters refer to the fact that Wilkes was
		  passed over for promotion to rear admiral and to his reputation as an officer.
		  His wife Mary had much correspondence attempting to secure the promotion.
		  Wilkes was not promoted to rear admiral on the retired list until 1866. On June
		  1, 1863, he was detached from the West India Squadron and recalled home.
		  Unfortunately his letters for this period at sea, 1861-1863, are not included
		  in this collection. Only a handful of letters exist for 1864; two of them are
		  from Wilkes to Gideon Welles concerning Wilkes's court-martial.</p>
         
         <p>Family letters during the Civil War are concentrated mainly in 1862
		  and 1863, while Wilkes was at sea. His wife and two older daughters remained in
		  Washington, D. C., and in their letters they discuss prominent citizens of the
		  city, army generals, naval officers, and activities there. Many letters refer
		  to business and financial matters.</p>
         
         <p>At the conclusion of the Civil War, John Wilkes's letters from
		  Charlotte to his father resume. John was at this time serving as the first
		  president of the First National Bank of Charlotte and had resumed operations at
		  the Mecklenburg Iron Works which he owned. His letters relate to business and
		  economic conditions in North Carolina and the South during Reconstruction,
		  making a start again after the Civil War, and business and financial matters.
		  Wilkes was in a partnership that owned the Rock Island Manufacturing Company;
		  letters refer to its financial problems. In about 1866, Charles Wilkes moved to
		  Gaston County, North Carolina, where he had purchased the High Shoals Iron
		  Works. He had a contract of sale, but no deed, so protracted legal battles
		  ensued. The Iron Works continued to produce batches of pig iron and manufacture
		  nails. Letters in the collection pertain to the Iron Works and its production.
		  Only a few letters exist for 1868 and 1869.</p>
         
         <p>The correspondence for the 1870s consists primarily of family letters,
		  mostly written by John Wilkes to his father. Letters continue about the
		  problems of the Rock Island Manufacturing Company, which had failed in about
		  1869. Other letters concern the Mecklenburg Iron Works, which was at one time
		  called the Mecklenburg Foundry and Machine Shops, of which he was proprietor.
		  He also referred to the continued question of ownership of the High Shoals Iron
		  Works and the appropriation for the work of the Exploring Expedition in 1870. A
		  few other letters were written by Mary and Edmund Wilkes, who went to live in
		  Salt Lake City in 1871, but returned to New York later.</p>
         
         <p>Other letters for the 1870s pertain to the Exploring Expedition.
		  Charles Wilkes wrote to Lot M. Morrill about publishing the volumes of the work
		  of the expedition. There are letters from Frederick D. Stuart, assistant to
		  Wilkes, concerning funds to finish the publication of the Exploring Expedition
		  volumes. It was difficult in the later years to obtain this funding from
		  Congress.</p>
         
         <p>The two clippings are a picture of Charles Wilkes and an article,
		  1862, concerning publication of the results of the Exploring Expedition.</p>
         
         <p>The financial papers, 1830-1875, include such items as financial
		  statements, Exploring Expedition statements, bills, receipts, cost estimate,
		  and a bond.</p>
         
         <p>In the legal papers, which span the years 1827-1865, are indentures,
		  many of which are signed by Charles Wilkes and Richard B. Mason, among other
		  parties. Also included are articles of association and other papers for the
		  Jackson City Association, a signed approval by Secretary of the Navy Isaac
		  Toucey of a summons to Wilkes for a trial, and undated plats. There are court
		  documents, such as agreements, summons, a complaint, and a memorandum. Some of
		  these items pertain to litigation concerning a Lynch vs. Wilkes family real
		  estate dispute.</p>
         
         <p>The miscellany consists of papers, 1825-1875. Exploring Expedition
		  items include a memo in 1838 concerning the acting appointments as commanders
		  of Charles Wilkes and William H. Hudson, magnetic measurements, and in 1858 a
		  few items about revisions to various maps and publications of the expedition.
		  Three depositions occur in this section in 1862 concerning fortifications at
		  Drewry's Bluff. They are written by a deserter from the Confederate Navy, a
		  former Confederate soldier, and a New York soldier who had been behind
		  Confederate lines. Other Civil War papers in 1863 and 1864 relate to the
		  court-martial of Wilkes.</p>
         
         <p>The printed material spans the years 1849 to 1874. Included is a
		  broadside that General John James Peck penned on September 20, 1864, entitled, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Siege of
		  Suffolk-Chancellorsville.</title> The purpose of the paper was to debunk the
		idea that any significant portion of Longstreet's army was transferred to
		Chancellorsville. In the printed material also is 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Report on the High Shoals
		  Property in Gaston County, North Carolina</title> by F. Winter. This is a proof
		of the pamphlet written in 1873 concerning the geology of High Shoals. Other
		titles are 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Working the Gold Mines in
		  New Granada,</title>
            
            <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Prospectus of the
		  <emph render="italic">American Review,</emph>
            
            </title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Map of the City of
		  Zanesville.</title>
         
         </p>
         
         <p>While the writings cover the two years, 1862 to 1863, most of them are
		  undated. Included is a copy in Italian of 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">In difesa del San
		  Giacinto,</title> 1862, by Michele Costi. This was a defense of Wilkes's
		actions in the <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> affair. An English
		translation of this item was published as a pamphlet under the title, 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Memoir on the Trent
		  Affair.</title> A copy is housed in the Rare Book Room. Related items are 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Surrender of Mason and
		  Slidell</title> written in Wilkes's hand and another article, both of which
		defend his actions in the <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> affair. Copies of 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Naval Reform</title> and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Abuses in the Navy,</title>
		1862, are also included. Two folders contain the sixteen-chapter manuscript 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Trip to the Far
		  West</title> by Charles Wilkes in 1863. The narrative is comprised of
		descriptions of the localities visited, including Pennsylvania, Illinois,
		Indiana, Milwaukee, the Mississippi River, St. Paul, Iowa (especially Dubuque),
		St. Louis, Cincinnati, Erie, New York--Buffalo and Niagara Falls, Maryland,
		Delaware, New Jersey, and New York City. 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Canal Trip in Peru</title>
		is listed as being included with the manuscript but is not a part of this
		collection. Other undated writings describe various aspects of New York City,
		iron-clad vessels, New Jersey, and Baltimore.</p>
         
         <p>The volumes, 1823-1847, include account books of Charles Wilkes, a
		  notebook owned by Edmund Wilkes, and 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Notes related to Fejee
		  [sic] Islands.</title> There is an account book for the ship
		<emph render="italic">O'Cain,</emph> 1823, maintained while Wilkes was on a
		trip to ports in the South Atlantic on a sealing voyage. Wilkes was in command
		of the ship, which was fitted out by its owner, Mr. Winship. Other financial
		records of Charles Wilkes are in three Daybooks of Receipts and Expenses,
		1828-1829, 1829-1832, and 1833-1835. Edmund Wilkes kept the notebook in 1847
		while he was a student in Philadelphia. Evidently it was from a chemistry
		course. Charles Wilkes wrote 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Notes related to Fejee
		  [sic] Islands</title> from July 15 to August 7, 1840, while on the Exploring
		Expedition.</p>
         
         <p>Two oversize items are in oversize storage: 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Map of the World shewing
		  [sic] the Extent and Direction of the Wind and the Route To Be Followed in a
