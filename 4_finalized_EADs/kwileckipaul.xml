         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         <p>The Paul Kwilecki Photographs and Papers span the
		  years 1960-2008 and include black and white photographic
		  prints, negatives, contact sheets, photographer's notes, journals (closed until 2017), writings, speeches,
		  correspondence related to photography, and other printed material. The bulk of the collection consists of Paul Kwilecki's black and white prints and other photographic material documenting rural and small-town life in and around Bainbridge, Decatur County, Georgia, an undertaking he began as a self-taught photographer in 1960 and continued until his death in 2009. Although Kwilecki developed an interest in photography in the 1940s, only a very small portion of the images in the collection pre-date 1970. The collection is organized into two major series: <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials</emph>, containing prints, contact sheets, and negatives, and a <emph render="bold">Manuscripts Series</emph> housing many files of correspondence, writings, and other personal papers. Significant correspondents include photographers Alex Harris and David Vestal.</p>
         
         <p>The prints in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Photographic Materials Series</ref> (543 11x14 black and white prints and 40 oversized prints) are arranged topically. The contact sheets and negatives are in original order as received. While initially interested in photographing the shade tobacco workers of Decatur County beginning in the 1960s, Kwilecki turned his focus to other subjects. Among those included in the collection are: religious life (the most extensively addressed), social events, county fairs, agriculture, local industry, workers, shoppers, stores, houses, and landscapes. Many of Kwilecki's subjects come from the African American community in Decatur County. Other images in the collection document the life and environment of the Decatur County Court House, many Decatur County churches and cemeteries, the Flint River, Willis Park, Battle's Quarters (an African-American neighborhood), and the Trailways Bus Station.</p>
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Manuscripts
		  Series</ref> (1967-2008) also provides an interpretation of life in
		  Decatur County but also documents Kwilecki's photographic philosophy and practices. The correspondence and the journals, related to Kwilecki's work and career as a photographer, comprise the largest groupings. His personal journals dating from 1967-1969 are closed to use until 2017. The series also contains news clippings, exhibition brochures, Kwilecki's printing notes, and a brief internet biography of Kwilecki. Many of Kwilecki's writings attempt to express in words the same topics he tried to illuminate through photography. Additional manuscripts (14 boxes) were received in 2010 following Kwilecki's passing away; they have been minimally processed in the original order as received, and include many folders of correspondence dating from 1971-2008, arranged in original order either chronologically or alphabetically by folder title. Correspondents include the photographers Nicholas Puner, David Vestal and Alex Harris. Other files contain writings, clippings, and other items. The writings include journalistic entries from the 1970s; typed excerpts from early 20th century Georgia newspapers, some on racial incidents; drafts of Kwilecki's talks; and notes for the Decatur County photography publication (one folder). A few publications round out the last box in the collection.</p>

         <p>Paul Kwilecki's personal library of dozens of books on photography and other publications was cataloged separately for Duke University's David M.

               <p>This series includes 582 black and white
				prints (543 11x14 prints and 40 oversized prints), as well as contact sheets and prints, and negatives. Kwilecki
				identified prints by a unique number indicating the roll
				number, the month and year, and the frame number. However,
				there are quite a few without print numbers; these are
				designated as "Print unnumbered." He also normally supplied
				a title and a date, although some have no title. All
				photographs were taken by Kwilecki in order to document the
				life and culture of Decatur County, Georgia and the individuals
				who live there. Boxes PHO 1-10 contain prints arranged
				topically under the following main headings arranged and
				designated by Kwilecki: Decatur County Court House;
				Cemeteries; County Fairs; Battle's Quarters; Bainbridge,
				Ga.; Agriculture; Flint River, Ga.; Industry; Houses;
				Landscapes; Laura Pope; Pear Orchard; Portraits; Religion;
				Shoppers; Shade Tobacco; Social Events; Stores; Swine Time;
				Trailways Bus Station; Workers; and Willis Park. The
				largest grouping is under Religion (8 folders). The
				Portraits Series includes a self-portrait of Kwilecki.</p>
               
               <p>Within these topical groupings, prints are
				sometimes arranged chronologically (though never
				consistently so) or grouped together under
				<emph render="doublequote">sub-topics.</emph> The descriptive
				captions to the prints in Boxes PHO 1-10 (in quotes) are
				supplied by Kwilecki, often in the first person. So too,
				the title
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Understandings</title> has
			 been included with various prints to indicate that they
			 appear in Kwilecki's book of that name, published in 1981.
			 Oversized Box 1 contains oversized prints whose arrangement
			 corresponds to the main series headings listed above. As in
			 boxes PHO 1-10, certain prints also include Kwilecki's
			 photographic captions and/or the title
			 <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Understandings.</title>
			 Titles or dates in brackets have been supplied by the
			 processing archivist.</p>
               
               <p>Original negatives (closed to use) and contact sheets were received upon Kwilecki's passing in 2009, and are in original order as received.</p>
