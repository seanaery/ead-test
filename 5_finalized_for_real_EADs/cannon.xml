            <p>Processed by David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library Staff</p>
            
            
            <p>Encoded by Gabriela A. Montoya</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Processing Note: The pre-processing arrangement of these surviving records was also random. The company had stored parts of their earlier records in various places, and either the major part of its archives had never been stored or else had been discarded. Thus, retention, storage, and retrieval for this collection were all random. The result was a jigsaw puzzle that had to be both designed and assembled during processing.</p>
            
            
            <p>The provenance of the files was greatly disturbed, and the structure and location of many files in the company's offices is unclear. Effort has been made to assign files to series appropriate to the office or constituent company to which they belonged, but, in many cases, filing represents a processing decision rather than known provenance.</p>
            
            
            <p>The executive office files are a particular case of mixed provenance. The five series for 1950, 1952, 1970, 1971, and 1979 remain in their original arrangement, but where they were kept in the company's main office is not clear. Correspondence of major executives is in these files, but letters for the same individuals are also in other series. The Executive Office Files Series, 1923-1980, is largely a repository of records for which reconstitution of provenance required undue time and effort. The term "Executive Office Files" was adopted in order to indicate that these files usually represent the higher levels of the managerial structure.</p>
            
            
            <p>Each series contains one or the other or both of two form divisions: Boxed Files and Volumes; and Volumes Shelved in Numerical Sequence. The Boxed Files and Volumes are mostly files, but some volumes are included, usually for better preservation. The Volumes Shelved in Numerical Sequence are mostly account books, many of them too large for housing in boxes.</p>
            
            
            <p>Printed publications removed from the collection are partial files of "Cotton's Week," "Kiplinger Agricultural Letter," "Kiplinger Tax Letter," "Kiplinger Washington Letter," Whaley- Eaton Services "American Letter" and "Foreign Letter," "Textile Hi-Lights," "Textile Trends," Babson's "Weekly Staff Letter," "Gallagher President's Report," "The Corporate Shareholder," and the "Seidman News Bulletin."</p>

         <p>The Cannon Mills Records, a textile manufacturer, span the years 1836-1983, although the bulk occurs during 1887-1983. Files and account books concern the operations of Cannon Manufacturing Company and its successor in 1928, Cannon Mills, its subsidiary and associated textile mills, related business interests, and community involvement. The records include correspondence, volumes, memoranda, statistical compilations, reports, printed material, and financial and legal documents.</p>
         
         
         <p>In 1898 Cannon Manufacturing Company switched to towel manufacturing, and in later years the product line expanded into blankets. In 1971 sales exceeded $305 million, and the company dominated over 50% of the country's towel business and over 20% of the sheet business.</p>
         
         
         <p>Important topics include the textile industry, economic conditions related to the textile industry, textile marketing and sales, state and national textile industry associations and public and governmental relations; textile industry consolidation; textile equipment and manufacturers; textile production and costs; an antebellum textile mill; and the Cannon, Patterson, Swink, Odell, Barringer, Johnston, Murdoch, and other families who were owners and managers of one or more of the textile mills.</p>
         
         
         <p>Topics and materials related to personnel are millworkers (both men and women), child labor (both girls and boys), employee retirement plans, the Textile Workers Union of America, time books, employee injuries, company mercantile stores, and mill houses and villages.</p>
         
         
         <p>Other business activities involved building construction, architects, and contractors; investment in securities and commodities; advertising; taxation; stock and stockholders (both men and women); corporate directors; insurance; bankruptcy and bad debts; cotton brokers; cotton buying and the cotton market; dividends; banks and banking; mill superintendents' records; real estate; lawsuits, one involving racial discrimination; and estate settlements.</p>
         
         
         <p>Community relations are evident in records relating to churches, schools, the Y.M.C.A., Freemasons, philanthropy to local organizations, and secondary boarding schools in North Carolina and the inception of agricultural training for boys and home economics for girls. The city of Kannapolis, N.C., in which the main offices of Cannon were located, was a particular focus of company interest.</p>
         
         
         <p>There are record series for the nine companies that were consolidated in 1928 to form Cannon Mills: Cannon Manufacturing Company, Cabarrus Cotton Mills, Barringer Manufacturing Company, Franklin Cotton Mills, Gibson Manufacturing Company, Kesler Manufacturing Company, Patterson Manufacturing Company, Norcott Mills Company, and Hobarton Manufacturing Company. These mills were all in the western Piedmont of North Carolina.</p>
         
         
         <p>A number of other mills, owned by or associated with the Cannons or Cannon Mills, had a separate existence in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Those mills, represented in this collection by series, include Central Mills, Central, S.C.; Bloomfield Manufacturing Co., Statesville, N.C.; Brown Manufacturing Co., Concord, N.C.; Roberta Manufacturing Co., Cabarrus County, N.C.; Imperial Cotton Mills, Eatonton, Georgia; Social Circle Cotton Mills, Walton County, Georgia, Swink Manufacturing Company, Rowan County, N.C.; Travora Textiles, Graham and Haw River, N.C.; Windemere Knitting Mills, Albemarle, N.C.; and Wiscassett Mills, Albemarle, N.C. Other mills, not represented here by series, were related to the Cannon group, and information about them occasionally appears in the collection. These firms include: Amazon Cotton Mills, Thomasville, N.C.; Durham Hosiery Mills; Efird Manufacturing Co., Albemarle, N.C.; Tuscarora Cotton Mill, Mt. Pleasant, N.C.; Buck Creek Cotton Mills, Siluria, Ala.; and Paola Cotton Mills, Statesville, N.C.</p>
         
         
         <p>Basic information about these textile mills can be found in the annual volumes of Davidson's Textile Blue Book. The size and products of many of the factories varied over the years.</p>
         
         
         <p>The huge Cannon corporation also had related business interests and community involvements that are represented by organizations and record series in this collection. They include: Cannon Mills, Inc., the selling agency in New York City; Cannon of West Coast, Inc.; L. T. Barringer and Co., a cotton brokerage firm in Memphis, Tennessee; the Brown-Roberta Foundation, a community philanthropy; J. A. Skipwith and Co., cotton brokers at Concord, N.C.; Klumac Cotton Mills, Salisbury, N.C.; P. M. Morris Real Estate Company, Concord, N.C.; Rowan County Farm Life School; and the Trading and
Commission Company, a selling agency and holding company.</p>
         
         
         <p>The series in this collection represent executives, offices, a department, subsidiary companies, affiliated companies, and related businesses and organizations. The general arrangement of the 47 series is: reference information; members of the Cannon family; executive offices; executives; a department; and numerous companies, businesses, and organizations, these arranged mostly alphabetically.</p>
         
         
         <p>The surviving files and volumes represent only a small percentage of the original archives. Some parts of the company have considerable papers in this collection, but no series is anywhere near complete. Some series are quite small. Record survival was random, but many important and useful files and account books are available.</p>
         
         
         <p>Information about particular topics, companies, and individuals is often scattered in a number of series in this collection, and the container list serves as a guide to many of them. It should be remembered that company activities may be reflected by bookkeeping entries in the account books whether or not relevant files are available. Because of the interlocking relationships of the various companies, information about one firm may not be exclusive to its own series.</p>

               <p>Correspondence, memoranda, legal and financial papers, reports, and volumes centering upon the founder of Cannon Mills. Important files relating to mill operations concern the early years of Buck Creek Cotton Mills at Siluria, Ala., and Cannon's management of Paola Cotton Mills at Statesville, N.C. There is considerable financial data and some correspondence for the New York office. A record book contains early production, cost, labor and other statistics. Overseer Joseph D. Bacon's reminiscences provide a vignette of J. W. Cannon's early years in management. T. C. Thompson, a builder and contractor, was associated with Cannon in Buck Creek Cotton Mills.</p>
               
               
               <p>Information about J. W. Cannon's finances and personal investments is extensive. It includes his dealing with H. Hentz and Co., J. S. Bache and Co., and the Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. of New York City. Trading in securities and commodities was considerable. There is also some record of other ventures such as real estate and oil production.</p>
               
               
               <p>Papers relating to Cannon and his family include wills, estate records, and financial documents and accounts. Files for the settlement of the estate of Mrs. Cannon's uncle, Aaron J. Bost, are extensive, and securities investments are itemized.</p>

               <p>Correspondence, memoranda, legal and financial papers, reports, and volumes relating to C. A. Cannon, the company's manager from 1921 to 1971. There are notable files for the advertising agencies of Young and Rubicam, N. W. Ayer and Son, and the Market Research Corporation of America. External public relations and industry concerns were expressed through such organizations as the American Cotton Manufacturers Association, American Cotton Manufacturers Institute, National Cotton Council, Textile Committee on Public Relations, and the Committee for a National Trade Policy. Lawsuits between Cannon and the Collector of Internal Revenue and the estate of William A. Stribling, a cotton buying and receiving agent, caused the compilation of considerable information and financial statistics about Cannon Mills and some of its subsidiary and related mills. There are also records from the antebellum Concord Steam Manufacturing Co.; the Odell Manufacturing Co.; Charles Cannon's investments and cash transactions; the securities investments of James W. Cannon and Mary Ella (Bost) Cannon; the estate of Thomas T. Smith, a former secretary of Cannon Manufacturing; the consolidation of 1928; and a lodge of Freemasons at Concord, N.C.</p>

               <p>These files are considerably more complete than those in the series for 1950. Larger files include: miscellaneous correspondence; several mills in the Cannon group, especially Central and Wiscassett; state and national industry organizations; Ewing-Thomas Corp. of Chester, Pa., and the U.S. government (New York Quartermaster Procurement Agency). many important writers and topics appear in the extensive miscellaneous correspondence files. Cannon, Swink, Ridenhour, Batte, and Haywood continue to be principals in the correspondence. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Minute books of stockholders and directors and considerable financial information and scattered records for payroll, production, sales, tenants, consolidation with Cannon Mills, and construction. The account books are ledgers, journals, and cashbooks. James W. Cannon and his sons founded the mill in 1906. The factory, operator of 25,500 spindles in 1927 producing warp yarns, became Cannon Mills' Plant No. 9 in 1928. Files arranged alphabetically and volumes shelved numerically.</p>

Rare and unusual access to the operations of a textile factory is provided by the diary of Superintendent John C. Mason who managed Kesler. The Cannons and the Rev. Francis Johnstone Murdoch became stockholders and executives. In 1925 the mill had 27,456 spindles and produced sheetings. During the consolidation of 1928 Kesler became Cannon Mills' Plant No. 7.

               <p>Customer files, lawsuits, correspondence, financial statements, sales invoices, and weekly production and sales reports of this factory at Salisbury, N.C., that produced damask and rayon bedspreads. Klumac sold its goods through Cannon Mills in New York City, and Cannon also assisted with finishing work in North Carolina. Klumac had economic difficulties in the mid-1930s, went into receivership, and did not operate for several years. Cannon sued Klumac in 1934. The records document the Cannon-Klumac relationship and its difficulties. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

Account books include ledgers, financial statements and inventories, stockholder records, statements of costs and superintendent's reports, cashbooks, early time books, production statistics, cotton records, and sales. patterson was one of the earlier components of the Cannon textile empire. James W. Cannon and J. Frank Patterson established the factory at China Grove, Rowan Co., N.C., in 1893. The mill, operator of 11,056 spindles producing sheeting and yarns, became Cannon Mills Plant No. 8 in the consolidation of 1928. Records of the Patterson Store Company, a general store, contain the names and accounts of many millworkers. Extensive invoices and checkbook stubs provide a rare sample of the nuts and bolts operation of a textile mill during its early years as well as filling some bookkeeping gaps. Files arranged alphabetically and volumes shelved numerically.</p>
