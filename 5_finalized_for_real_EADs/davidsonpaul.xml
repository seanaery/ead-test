         <abstract>Economist on the faculty at the University of Tennessee and editor of the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics. The Paul Davidson Papers span the years 1961-2004 and document his professional career and interests, including post-Keynesian economics; international monetary payments and global employment policies; monetary theory; income distribution; and energy economics. The collection almost exclusively consists of correspondence files, with the exception of a few clippings and speeches folders. The most notable group of correspondents are his fellow post-Keynesians such as Victoria Chick, Alfred Eichner, John Kenneth Galbraith, Geoff Harcourt, Jan Kregel, Hyman Minsky, Basil Moore, Luigi Pasinetti, Joan Robinson, Anthony Thirlwall, and Sidney Weintraub. Other correspondents of note include Philip Arestis, Peter Bernstein, Robert Clower, Robert Eisner, Sir John Hicks, Allan H. Meltzer, Edward Nell, Don Patinkin, James Tobin, and Paul Samuelson.  Other large amounts of correspondence and other materials relate to Davidson's editorial work with many major economics journals, including the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, which he founded; these folders typically contain correspondence between Davidson, journal referees, and authors. </abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Paul Davidson Papers span the years 1961-2004 and document his professional career and interests, including post-Keynesian economics; international monetary payments and global employment policies; monetary theory; income distribution; and energy economics. The collection almost exclusively consists of correspondence files, with the exception of a few clippings and speeches folders. The most notable group of correspondents are his fellow post-Keynesians such as Victoria Chick, Alfred Eichner, John Kenneth Galbraith, Geoff Harcourt, Jan Kregel, Hyman Minsky, Basil Moore, Luigi Pasinetti, Joan Robinson, Anthony Thirlwall, and Sidney Weintraub. Other correspondents of note include Philip Arestis, Peter Bernstein, Robert Clower, Robert Eisner, Sir John Hicks, Allan H. Meltzer, Edward Nell, Don Patinkin, James Tobin, and Paul Samuelson.  Other large amounts of correspondence and other materials relate to Davidson's editorial work with many major economics journals, including the <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Post Keynesian Economics</title>, which he founded; these folders typically contain correspondence between Davidson, journal referees, and authors. In one group of folders, Davidson engages with other colleagues in sometimes heated exchanges about bias in professional journals. In addition to correspondence with colleagues and authors, the files also contain correspondence related to academic departments where Davidson held positions. Reflecting his broad background, the papers also document Davidson's involvement with politics (see the Congress folder) and consultancy work for an energy company in his early career (the Oil and Energy folders), and his role as an active public figure, documented by letters to the editor for various maistream publications.

               <p>Exchanges reflect professional relationships Davidson maintained with colleagues in the United States, Italy, England, Japan, and other countries. There are also many folders of correspondence with academic institutions, media organizations, presses, and publishers, much of which stems from Davidson's many editorial roles for professional journals and other publications. Smaller amounts of correspondence relate to conferences and lectures. The more abundant files include corresponde with Milton Friedman, Geoff Harcourt, Sir John Hicks, Jan Kregel, and Sidney Weintraub; also, there is significant correspondence with economists whose papers are also held at Duke University, such as Clower, Patinkin, Perlman, and Samuelson. Arranged in alphabetical order by correpondent, publication, or topic; each alphabetical sequence is initiated by folders of routine or single-letter correpondence filed by letter rather than by name.  There is one file of correspondence containing letters with no last names indicated.</p>
