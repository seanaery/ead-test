         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>Dale B.J. Randall earned his B.A. from Western Reserve University in 1951, his M.A. from Rutgers University in 1953, and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1958. In 1957, he began teaching at Duke University as an Instructor in English, a position he had until 1960 when he was promoted to Assistant Professor. In 1970, he was promoted to Professor of English. He was also appointed Professor of Dramatic Literature in1991 and Professor of the Practice of Drama in 1994.</p>
         
         
         <p>
During his career, he served in several posts for the Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies and the Folger Institute of Renaissance and 18th century Studies, as Associate Dean of the Graduate School, and as Chair of the Duke Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. Additionally, Randall served as Interim Director of the Duke Drama Program (now the Dept. of Theatrical Studies) from 1991-1992, when the Program was close to collapsing. Under his leadership, the Program stabilized. Randall also published several works including <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">The Golden Tapestry: A Critical Survey of Non-Chivalric Spanish Fiction in English Translation, 1543-1657,</title> in 1963, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Joseph Conrad and Warrington Dawson: The Record of Friendship,</title> in 1968, <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Gentle Flame: The Life and Verse of Dudley, Fourth Lord North</title>, and <title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642-1660</title>.</p>
         
         
         <p>
He retired from Duke University in 1999 and was duly appointed both Professor Emeritus of English and Professor Emeritus of the Practice of Drama. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The largest part of the collection contains research material pertaining to Lord North, Joseph Conrad and Warrington Dawson, about whom Randall was writing books.  His research files include xerox copies, slides, illustrations and microfilm.  There are materials from Randall's time in the Dept. of English, particularly the controversy which occurred in the late 1980s-early 1990s. The controversy boiled down to a debate between traditionalists and revisionists. It made national headlines at the time, and Randall refers to it as "The Troubles." There are also syllabi, examination questions, and non-graded student papers.  Additionally, the collection contains material from Randall's time as Chair of the Drama Program and includes correspondence, programs, flyers, and clippings.  </p>
         
         
         <p>Randall's papers also include a copy of the written sexual harassment complaint a student made against an English professor in 1981.  This folder is restricted for 70 years. </p>
         
         
         <p>Both University Archives and Special Collections received material from Professor Randall.  The accessions have been merged into the finding aid presented here.</p>
