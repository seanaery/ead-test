         <abstract>The Picture File was created by the Duke
				University. David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library as a vertical
				file from the 1950s to the 1980s. Images were separated from manuscript collections
				as well as added individually from other sources. The Picture File is a large and diverse collection of
				visual materials ranging from the 17th through the 20th centuries. The bulk of the
				images in the collection date from the early 1800s through the 1950s. Formats
				represented include black and white photographic prints; cartes de visite, cabinet
				cards and other albumen prints; tintypes and daguerreotypes; engravings and
				lithographs; political cartoons; watercolors; sketches; postcards; stereographs;
				souvenir albums; leaflets; and small broadsides. Organized into four main series:
					Subjects, Geographic, Socialist Party, and People.
				The images offer representations of the landscape, culture, and history of most of
				the southern United States, especially Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
				Maryland, North and South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Many images of France,
				Italy, Germany, Japan, China, and some African countries can also be found; a large
				number of other countries and geographic locations are represented by only a few
				images. Many political figures and notable personages are portrayed; there are
				especially significant numbers of images of Eugene Debs, Socialist Party leader, and
				members of the Duke family of Durham, N.C. The history of that same city is also
				well-represented, in addition to other Southern cities and towns, including Raleigh
				N.C. Civil War images are abundant, offering views of battles and scenes of
				devastation both rural and urban. Other conflicts are also depicted, including the
				American Revolutionary War, Spanish-American War, and there are some images from
				both World Wars. A significant group of items in the People Series pertains to
				African Americans, ranging from studio portraits to caricatures of individuals and
				groups of individuals; a smaller group of images features depictions of Native
				Americans. Finally, the Picture File is home to collections of many engravings and
				lithographs produced by the 19th century American companies Currier and Ives, L.
				Prang and Co., and Kurz and Allison; many of them commemorate military leaders or
				events.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Picture File is a large and diverse collection of visual materials ranging from
				the 17th through the 20th centuries. The bulk of the images in the collection date
				from the early 1800s through the 1950s. Formats represented include black and white
				photographic prints; cartes de visite, cabinet cards and other albumen prints;
				tintypes and daguerreotypes; engravings and lithographs; political cartoons;
				watercolors; sketches; postcards; stereographs; souvenir albums; leaflets; and small
				broadsides. Organized into four main series: <emph render="bold">Subjects,
					Geographic, Socialist Party, and People</emph>. The images offer representations
				of the landscape, culture, and history of most of the southern United States,
				especially Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North and South Carolina,
				Tennessee and Virginia. Many images of France, Italy, Germany, Japan, China, and
				some African countries can also be found; a large number of other countries and
				geographic locations are represented by only a few images. Many political figures
				and notable personages are portrayed; there are especially significant numbers of
				images of Eugene Debs, Socialist Party leader, and members of the Duke family of
				Durham, N.C. The history of that same city is also well-represented, in addition to
				other Southern cities and towns, including Raleigh N.C.</p>
         
         
         <p>Civil War images are abundant, offering views of battles and scenes of devastation
				both rural and urban. Other conflicts are also depicted, including the American
				Revolutionary War, Spanish-American War, and there are some images from both World
				Wars. A significant group of items in the People Series pertains to African
				Americans, ranging from studio portraits to caricatures of individuals and groups of
				individuals; a smaller group of images features depictions of Native Americans.
				Finally, the Picture File is home to collections of many engravings and lithographs
				produced by the 19th century American companies Currier and Ives, L. Prang and Co.,
				and Kurz and Allison; many of them commemorate military leaders or events.</p>
         
         
         <p>The great majority of images in the the relatively small <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s1" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Subjects Series</ref> (about 120
				items) depict scenes from the Revolutionary, Civil, Spanish-American, and World
				Wars, but other images relate to such diverse subjects as
					architecture, automobiles, horses,
					ships, and politics. This series includes
				a large collection of Currier and Ives prints and American
				political cartoons.</p>
         
         
         <p>The much larger <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s2" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Geographic Series</ref> contains visual representations of many regions in the
				United States, with the largest concentration belonging to the Southern states.
				Almost half the series is comprised of images depicting Civil War
				scenes, during and after the war, and are chiefly engravings of battles or
				photographs of urban devastation. There are very few images of individual soldiers;
				however, there are reunion group photographs and portraits of Civil War military
				leaders (many more can be found in the <emph render="bold">People Series</emph>). A
				few images were taken by noted photographer Alexander Gardner.
				Other photographs and postcards, many from the 19th century, depict factories,
				buildings and monuments, street scenes in cities, social events,
				and rural landscapes. Durham, N.C. is especially
				well-represented, and many of the locations relate to the Duke
					family. Souvenir albums and
					postcards of Florida, New
					Orleans, Niagara Falls, and other
					tourist destinations appear frequently. Other geographical
				locations in this series include many European countries and Asian countries.
				Particularly of interest are early 20th century images of conflicts in Europe,
					Japan and China.</p>
         
         
         <p>The images in the <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s3" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Socialist Party Records Series</ref> provide a rich
				additional resource to the papers of the Socialist Party America, also held by the
				David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Subdivided into groupings
				entitled <emph render="bold">General, Geographic, Labor, and People</emph>, the
				series documents in visual form the history of the party and its membership, chiefly
				from the early 1900s to the 1970s, with emphasis on the decades from the 1920s
				through the 1940s. Images include portraits of leading individuals such as Eugene V.
				Debs, and photographs taken at many conventions and meetings throughout the U.S.
				Other scenes depicted include strikes, protests, and elections.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s4" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">People
					Series</ref> is the largest series, comprising nearly two-thirds of the
				collection. Portraits of well-known military, political, literary, religious, and
				historical figures from Western society are depicted chiefly through engravings,
				though there are many photographs of modern figures; all are arranged in
				alphabetical order. Confederate Civil War military figures are well represented.
				Subdivisions house images of Native Americans and African Americans, chiefly in
				photographs and postcards; the older and outdated series titles, Negroes and
				Indians, have been retained, but cross references have been provided using modern
				terms Native Americans and African Americans.</p>

         <p>To allow for better housing, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s5" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">negatives</ref>, <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s7" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">stereographs</ref>, and <ref xlink:type="simple" target="s6" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">cased
					images</ref> such as daguerreotypes have been separated into their own series. </p>
         
         
         <p>Oversize materials separated from the main collection at processing are housed in
				flat oversize boxes and appear listed in subseries at the end of each of the main
				series to which they belong. Cross-references to all separated materials are
				provided at the original folder locations from which items have been removed.
				Another large group of oversize materials separated earlier in the collection's
				history is listed in a separate series at the end of this finding aid; these items
				are housed in large oversize boxes belonging to the Special Collections Library's
				on-site oversize box run, and the largest are housed in the library's oversize
				cabinets. </p>
         
         
         <p>To facilitate access to all of the images and to undertake the most comprehensive
				search for materials, researchers may wish to contact the Research Services staff
				before using this collection.</p>

               <p>Items relating to a variety of subjects, including
							architecture, automobiles,
							fashion, political cartoons, and
							military conflicts, particularly the American
							Civil War but also the Revolutionary,
						Spanish-American, and World Wars. The Civil War images, which include
						several photographs by noted photographer Alexander
							Gardner, make up more than half of the Subjects Series; most
						of the items are engravings of battle scenes and photographs of battlefields
						and forts. The entire series is primarily comprised of
							engravings and
						photographs, though there are
							lithograph, paper prints,
						a souvenir album, photostats
						and tintypes as well. In addition, some materials
						were separated from the main collection to allow for better housing; these
						include negatives,
							stereographs, and oversized
							materials. Arranged alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Visual materials from a wide range of geographic locations separated into
						subseries. More than half of the subseries and materials are of various U.S.
						states, mostly on the Eastern seaboard. The majority of the U.S. material
						comes from the assorted subseries of the southern states, the largest of
						which are Georgia, North Carolina
						and South Carolina. Much of the North Carolina
						subseries features historical images of Durham,
						including a good deal of material focusing on the Bennett
							House, where General Johnston 
						surrendered to General Sherman in 1865.
						Internationally, the Geographic Series includes images from many different
						nations from around the world, ranging from Bolivia  to
							China to England; the most
						extensive of these international subseries are of European countries. The
						largest of these non-U.S. subseries concerns the travels of Robert
							Tracy Zimmerman in the Mediterranean
						area. The vast majority of the images in this series are of various
						landmarks and vistas in the featured states and countries. Most of these
						pictures of historical or geographic locales do not include people, but
						there are a significant number of street scenes and the like with many
						unidentified individuals. Images in this series are mostly photographs and
							engravings , though there are
							lithographs, paper prints,
							clippings, albums, and
							postcards as well. One of the more unusual genres
						is the “Illustrated Florida” collection of chromolithographs with identical
						slides in the Florida subseries. In addition, some
						items were separated from the main collection to allow for better housing;
						these include negatives,
							stereographs, and oversized
							materials. All subgroupings and items arranged
						alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Separated from the Socialist Party Records, held by the Rare Book,
						Manuscripts, and Special Collections Library, these visual materials concern
						American and occasionally international Socialism in the
						20th century, with occasional forays into the late 1800s. Organized into the
						following subseries: General, Geographic, Labor, and People. The General
						Subseries consists of images depicting a variety of subjects, ranging from
							Civil Rights protests in the U.S. to news photographs
						of the Nazi military buildup in the early 1930s. The
						contents of the much smaller Geographic and Labor Subseries depict locales
						of interest such as Berlin and
							Chicago, and various labor strikes in the 1940s and
						1950s, respectively. The largest subseries, People, contains portraits of
						various socialist leaders throughout the party’s history (both national and
						regional), with a large amount of material focusing on the life of five-time
						U.S. presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs. Also
						included in this subseries are groups of socialist legislators as well as
						assembled socialist conventions and delegations. The vast majority of the
						images in this series portray various events and individuals in Socialist
						Party history; however, there are also a few items which depict places of
						socialist interest, such as the city of Vienna or the
						party headquarters in Chicago. Images in this series
						are chiefly photographic; other formats include
							handbills,  clippings,
							sketches, black-and-white illustrations, a
							viewbook, and postcards.
						In addition, this series features an unusual genre in the pair of
							duotone plates found in the People subseries. As
						in the other series, some items were separated from the main collection to
						allow for better housing; these include negatives,
						stereographs, and oversized materials. All items
						arranged alphabetically.</p>

               <p>Making up about two-thirds of the Picture File collection, the People Series
						contains images of individuals and groups from many historical periods,
						separated into alphabetical subseries to facilitate access. The individuals
						depicted in this series come from widely different backgrounds, ranging from
						an unnamed peddler with his pack to famous  Shakespearean
							actors. However, the majority of the images depict prominent
						American and European (mostly British) men, such as political and/or
						military leaders, clergymen, and nobles. A large portion of the American
						individuals portrayed in this series are Civil War commanders, both Union
						and Confederate. The Duke family of Durham,
							NC is also well-represented in the material. In addition to
						the alphabetical subseries, arranged chiefly by last names, this series also
						contains two much smaller subseries focused specifically on Native
							Americans) and African Americans. The terms
						"Negroes" and "Indians" as used in the original Picture File collection have
						been retained for series titles as representative of the language used in
						their time; cross-references have been added within the box lists under
						"African Americans" and "Native Americans."</p>
               
               
               <p>Individual portraits make up the vast majority of items in this series. While
						most of these pictures are posed, there is a significant number of informal
						images as well as large gatherings of unidentified people. photographs and
						engravings make up the largest group of formats in the series, though there
						are also lithographs, photostats,
							clippings, various printed
							illustrations, tintypes,
							handbills, broadsides,
							sketches, and postcards.
						Some of the more unusual genres include a souvenir menu and a page from a
							scrapbook. In addition, some items were separated
						from the main collection to allow for better housing; these include
							cased images, negatives,
						stereographs, and oversized materials. All items are
						arranged alphabetically (the subseries "Negroes" and "Indians" are found
						within this alphabetical order).</p>

               <p>One of the smaller series in the Picture File, the Negatives Series is
						entirely composed of  negatives of various sizes
						removed from the four main series (Subjects, Geographic, Socialist Party
						Records, and People) to allow for better housing. The majority of these
						removed items came from the Subjects Series and concern the American
							Civil War; most, if not all, of these Civil War
						negatives are copies of items in the main series. Aside from the Civil War
						material, there are many items removed from the People Series, most of which
						are individual portraits. Arranged alphabetically. </p>

               <p>This series contains large-format visual materials removed from the Picture
						File over the last two decades and housed for preservation purposes in the
						library's on-site Oversize Box Run and in the Oversize Cabinets. Formats
						mainly include photographs, engravings and lithographs (all both colored and
						uncolored); but clippings,
							illustrations, albums, a
							sketch, and a handbill are
						also present. The subject matter of this material is diverse, ranging from
						nineteenth century political cartoons to
							American Socialist Party conventions. Significant
						groups of engravings, many commemorating wartime events or figures, were
						produced by Currier and Ives, L. Prang and
							Co., and Kurz and Allison. The materials
						in these separate oversize locations were organized in the same four series
						- and subseries - found in the main collection (Subjects, Geographic,
						Socialist Party Records, and People), with some variations. Geographic
						Series images are in the majority. Civil War and
							Political Cartoons groupings also feature a wide
						variety of images. Individual item entries are arranged in box and cabinet
						number sequence. Within groupings, items are arranged roughly in
						alphabetical order. However, series and sub-groupings are not necessarily in
						the same order as series in main collection. For rapid searching, keywords
						are most effective.</p>
