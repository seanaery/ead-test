         <abstract>U. S. thoracic surgeon and rare book and manuscript collector. The Josiah C. Trent papers consist mostly of correspondence and notes for and drafts of published and unpublished research and articles. The collection also includes miscellaneous printed material, photographs, and lecture notes taken as a medical student. There is also material relating to Dr. Trent's death and the subsequent donation of his large private rare book and manuscript collection to the Duke Medical Center Library. The bulk of the material documents Dr. Trent's activities and publications as collector and historian of medical practice, particularly surgery and epidemiology. Most of the correspondence chronicles Dr. Trent's involvement with various professional organizations and his acquaintance with prominent figures in various fields: medical history - John Fulton, Henry Sigerist, W. W. Francis; book collecting - Henry Schuman; Duke University - Wilburt Davison, Lenox D. Baker.  There is also some information concerning Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, Dr. Trent's wife. The collection also contains photographic prints and negatives reproducing medical illustrations and texts dating from the 16th century to the 20th century. These dates refer to the content of the images, rather than their date of creation by Dr. Trent in the 1930s and 1940s. Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Josiah C. Trent papers consist mostly of correspondence, photographs, research files, and notes and drafts of published and unpublished research and articles. Many of these materials concern Dr. Trent's activities and publications as a collector and historian of medical practice, particularly surgery and epidemiology. The collection also includes miscellaneous printed material, photographs, a cardfile, possibly of his personal library, and lecture notes taken as a medical student. There is also material relating to Dr. Trent's death and the subsequent donation of his large private rare book and manuscript collection to the Duke Medical Center Library.</p>
         
         
         <p>The correspondence chiefly chronicles Dr. Trent's involvement with various professional organizations and his acquaintance with prominent figures in various fields: medical history - John Fulton, Henry Sigerist, W. W. Francis; book collecting - Henry Schuman; Duke University - Wilburt Davison, Lenox D. Baker. This material can be found within the Subject Files Series. Some folders contain an index of the contents.  There is also some information concerning Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, Dr. Trent's wife, who was instrumental in facilitating the support of the history of medicine collections at Duke.  The collection also contains several hundred photographic prints and negatives of medical illustrations and texts dating from the 16th century to the 20th century. These dates refer to the content of the images, rather than their date of creation; they were assembled by Dr. Trent in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
         
         
         <p>The files were kept in Dr. Trent's medical office and contain relatively few items which pertain to his private life. Items of a more personal nature may be found in the James H. and Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans Family Papers in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.</p>

These dates refer to the content, and not to Dr. Trent's creation of the prints and negatives, which took place in the 1930s and 1940s. Many of the images are from German sources and some are housed in the Bettmann Archive. The prints and negatives are housed separately in 7.5x5.5 and 9x12 inch envelopes and arranged alphabetically by author or title. Unless otherwise noted, all titles include both negatives and prints.</p>
