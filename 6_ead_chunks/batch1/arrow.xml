         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Kenneth J. Arrow papers, 1939-2011 (bulk 1980s-1995),
		  document primarily the latter part of his career as an economist, professor, and Nobel Laureate. The collection provides a broad overview of his many
		  professional activities; administrative activities for various associations and committees and for his universities; and political activism in research notes, draft papers and speeches, and correspondence. Arrow's career is especially distinguished by his contributions to the theory of social choice, including his book 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Social Choice and Individual Values,</title>
		published in 1951, and his contributions to general equilibrium theory. For
		these achievements, Professor Arrow has been awarded the Johns Bates Clark
		Medal (1957) and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics (1972), which he shared
		with Professor Sir John Hicks. With an eleven year interruption at Harvard
		University from 1968 to 1979, Professor Arrow has spent the largest portion of
		his career at Stanford University. He has served as president of the American
		Economics Association and the International Economics Association, and has also
		been a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Some of the larger and more
		salient files in the collection include research notes on general equilibrium
		theory in economics; consulting on global climate change and contingent
		valuation; correspondence with Frank Hahn, Leonid Hurwicz, Alain Lewis, and
		Lionel McKenzie; and notes from graduate courses with Harold Hotelling.
		Although the collection contains primarily professional papers, there are some
		personal files as well as some concerning politics and activism.</p>
         
         
         <p>The 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="conf">Conferences, Lectures, and Speeches Series</ref>
		  includes information on organizations such as the Santa Fe Institute, National
		  Bureau of Economic Research, Social Choice and Welfare Conference, American
		  Economics Association, and International Economics Association. General
		  equilibrium theory material is in scattered files not only in this series but
		  also in the Notes, Papers, and Research Series.</p>
         
         
         <p>In the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="comm">Committees and Consulting Series</ref> contain files on
		  three extended projects on economic growth and policy, global climate change,
		  and contingent valuation. Also, the American Economics Association,
		  International Economics Association, and the National Academy of Sciences are
		  represented. There is a subseries on economics journals.</p>
         
         
         <p>The 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="corr">Correspondence and Personal Files Series</ref>
		  includes correspondence with a number of eminent economists, including M.
		  Allais, G. Debreu, M. Friedman, F. Hahn, J. Harsanyi, L. Hurwicz, T. Koopmans,
		  L. McKenzie, R. Marschak, and R. Radner; with other scholars such as N.
		  Chomskey, S.J. Gould, and J. Hirschleifer; with politicians, including D.P.
		  Moynihan; as well as extensive notes and correspondence with some of Arrow's
		  Ph.D. students, including A. Lewis.</p>
         
         
         <p>In the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="note">Notes, Papers, and Research Series</ref> are notes
		  on production functions, stability, uncertainty; economic theory, optimization,
		  and decentralization; National Science Foundation grants; 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Social Choice and Multicriterion
		  Decision-Making;</title> and notes from courses with Harold Hotelling.</p>
         
         
         <p>Departments of Economics are represented in the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="stan">Stanford and Harvard Series</ref>, and the 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="misc">Miscellaneous Series</ref> has a folder on Arrow's
		  Nobel Prize and other awards. The 
		  <ref xlink:type="simple" target="poli">Politics and Activism Series</ref> contains files on
		  the Middle East, arms control (especially Economists against the Arms Race),
		  human rights, and UNESCO.</p>
         
         
         <p>Additions to the collection have been intellectually integrated into their corresponding series but are physically housed separately in boxes 38-53.</p>

               <p>This series will likely be of most interest to scholars of
				Professor Arrow's contributions to economic theory. While, like the other
				series, the bulk of this series dates after 
				 1970, it does include files from earlier periods. The
				Class Notes and Theses Subseries contains notes from his undergraduate courses
				at 
				City College of New York and graduate courses
				at 
				Columbia University, including notes from 
				Professor H. Hotelling's course in
				Mathematical Economics and a penultimate draft of his Masters Thesis. It also
				includes notes on meteorology in preparation for his work in the 
				Army Air Corps.  A subseries on Notes and
				Papers by 
				Arrow also contains earlier work. The most
				extensive files in this subseries include notes on optimization and
				decentralization, a 
				National Science Foundation project on
				production functions, stability, and uncertainty.</p>
               
               
               <p> The rest of the series contains work dating after 
				<unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"> 1970. </unitdate> The Notes for papers
				by 
				Arrow Subseries contains drafts and notes for
				specific papers. The Ongoing Grants Subseries contains several projects funded
				by the 
				National Science Foundation and the 
				Office of Naval Research.  The Notes Subseries
				contains files of notes relating to various topics, but seemingly unconnected
				to any specific paper. The last subseries, Festschrift and papers in the
				history of economic thought, contains files on those activities.</p>
