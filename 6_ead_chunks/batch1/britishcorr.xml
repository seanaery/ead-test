         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The materials comprising the British
		  Correspondence and Miscellany Collection are dated from 
		  <unitdate type="inclusive" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1556 to 1972 (bulk
			 1740-1890)</unitdate>. The papers are arranged into the
		  following series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence,
		  1556-1972 and undated; Subject Files, 1699-1902 and undated;
		  Pictures, 1795-1921 and undated; and Miscellaneous Material,
		  1814-1836 and undated</emph> An artificial collection, the
		  papers are, for the most part, unrelated by provenance. The
		  collection consists chiefly of correspondence, and topics
		  include numerous political events and activities of the
		  18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries in Great Britain and
		  the colonies (particularly India and Africa).</p>
         
         
         <p> The <emph render="bold">Correspondence

		correspondence concerning a transport ship wrecked in the
		Tagus during his last Iberian campaign (Canning

		accompanying circulars (1804 and 1805) from the War Office
		(Dundas correspondence); and correspondence (and
		accompanying transcripts) between King George I and M.
		Braconnier (1709) concerning the King's inability to send a
		detachment large enough to oppose the French along the
		borders of the Rhone and Lake Geneva (George I
		correspondence). Other items include correspondence
		relating to George Henry's mission in Nyasaland (Henry
		correspondence); material concerning the cargo ship
		<emph render="doublequote">The Sea Witch</emph> (Lenty
		correspondence); correspondence regarding Marsden-Smedley's
		unsuccessful campaign for Parliament in 1910

		correspondence). The Murray correspondence includes
		handwritten biographical notes and a printed review (1908)
		of David Christie Murray's 
		<title xlink:type="simple" render="italic">Reflections</title>.</p>
         
         
         <p> Papers in the <emph render="bold">Subject Files
		  Series</emph> concern a wide range of political, military,
		  and economic matters. They include an anonymous account
		  (1743) of the battle of Dettingen (in French); papers
		  (1856-1860 and undated) relating to the raising of ships at
		  Sebastopol during the Crimean War; a collection of letters
		  from various correspondents concerning decimal currency
		  (1856-1869); papers concerning Newfoundland fisheries
		  (1901-1902); and a document pertaining to the impressment
		  of sailors (1745). </p>

               <p>This series includes letters to and from
				numerous British notables concerning political events
				spanning five centuries. Letters are arranged
				alphabetically by author. When the author could not be
				ascertained, the letter was filed under the name of the
				recipient, and this was noted in the finding aid. Letters
				of titled persons are filed under the title rather than the
				surname when the title could be determined. In some cases,
				this was not possible. Researchers are advised to search
				for correspondence of particular people under both title
				and surname. In cases where there are several letters by
				one author, the letters were placed in a folder with that
				author's name and filed at the end of the folders beginning
				with that letter of the alphabet. (Example: After the
				alphabetically arranged <emph render="doublequote">A</emph>
				letters, there are folders containing letters by George
				Douglas Campbell, the 8th Duke of Argyll, and William
				George Eden, the 2nd Baron Auckland.). Unidentified letters
				appear at the end of the alphabetical range. </p>
