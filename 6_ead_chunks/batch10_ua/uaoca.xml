         <abstract>The Duke University Office of Cultural Affairs
        was created in 1969 as part of the Division of Student Affairs and existed until 1993, when,
        as part of a reorganization of the Division, it was superceded by the Office of University
        Life. The Office of Cultural Affairs Records, 1931-2002 (bulk
        1958-2002), consist of budgets and financial reports; calendars; contracts; correspondence;
        meeting minutes; printed materials; black-and-white, color, and 35mm photographs; and
        videocassettes, audiocassettes, and digital audio tapes. Materials primarily span the years
        of the OCA's official existence, 1969-1993, but also contain earlier materials about its
        first director, Ella Fountain Pratt, and later records created by the Office of University
        Life. Arranged in five series: Subject Files, which provide a broad overview of the OCA's
        activities, including early correspondence between Duke University and the American Dance
        Festival, which moved to Duke in 1977; the Chamber Arts Society, a group that promoted
        chamber music performance in Durham and surrounding areas; the Duke Artists Series, a
        concert series that began in 1930 and came under the oversight of OCA upon its creation in
        1969; the Summer Session, programming for which also became one of the OCA's primary
        responsibilities; and the Triangle Dance Guild, a group independent of Duke that coordinated
        with the OCA to promote dance performance on campus and in Durham and surrounding areas from
        1976-1984.</abstract>

         <p>The Duke University Office of Cultural Affairs was created in 1969 as part of the Division
        of Student Affairs and directed by Ella Fountain Pratt from its inception until 1984. Pratt
        was succeeded by Susan L. Cook, who served as Director until 1993, when the Office was
        superceded by the Office of University Life as part of a reorganization of the Division.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Office of Cultural Affairs Records, 1931-2002 (bulk
          1958-2002)</emph>, consist of budgets and financial reports, calendars, contracts,
        correspondence, meeting minutes, photographs, and printed materials that document the
        Office's administration and scheduling of concerts and other performing arts events, arts
        festivals, and certain performance venues and buildings on the campus of Duke University.
        The majority of these records span the years of the OCA's official existence, 1969-1993; but
        there are also older materials that stem from the earlier Duke career of the OCA's initial
        director, Ella Fountain Pratt, as well as later records created under the Office of
        University Life, which superceded the OCA in 1993. Audiovisual material in the collection
        include more than 500 black-and-white, color, and 35mm photographs; additionally, there are
        several videocassettes, audiocassettes, and digital audio tapes. The collection is arranged
        in five series beginning with the most general, Subject Files, followed in alphabetical
        order by four smaller and more specific series that document the history of various concert
        series or arts organizations. </p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> are not only the largest series but also give
        the broadest overview of the OCA's activities. Several large folder groups exist within the
        series, including one that contains early correspondence and negotiations between Duke
        University and the American Dance Festival, which moved to Duke in 1977. The series also
        contains correspondence and other records that span Pratt's entire career at Duke, from the
        late 1950s through her retirement in 1984. The next four series document the history of
        various concert series or artistic groups that were either administrated by or collaborated
        with the OCA. The first and largest of these series is the <emph render="bold">Chamber Arts
          Society. </emph> Founded in 1945 to promote chamber music performance in Durham , this
        group eventually came under the aegis of Duke University and the Office of Cultural Affairs
        in 1975. Although files here tell a little of that early history, they primarily document
        some fifteen years of concerts on campus from the mid-1980s through 2002. Following this are
        the records of the <emph render="bold">Duke Artists Series</emph>, a concert series that
        began in 1930. When the OCA was created in 1969, management and oversight of the Duke
        Artists Series was made one of its primary responsibilities. The files here mainly document
        several seasons of concerts in the late 1980s and late 1990s. Much like the Duke Artists
        Series, cultural programming for the University's <emph render="bold">Summer Session
          Series</emph> also became a primary responsibility of the OCA upon its creation. This
        series covers more than forty years of summer session history, including programming that
        continued under the Office of University Life. The final series contains the history of the
          <emph render="bold">Triangle Dance Guild.</emph> Independent of Duke, this group existed
        from 1976-1984 and coordinated with the OCA to promote dance performance on campus and in
        Durham and other local venues.</p><!-- OPTIONAL: Use Arrangement clip here for Collection Arrangement section -->

               <p>Materials relating to the administration and management of the Office of Cultural
            Affairs, including budgets, box office reports, correspondence, event and season
            calendars, and files about specific artists and performances. In addition to the wide
            variety of individual files, four larger folder groups in the series document the
            following subjects in greater detail: Ella Fountain Pratt's work on the exective board
            of the Association of College, University and Community Arts Administrators (ACUCAA);
            recruitment of the American Dance Festival (ADF) to Duke in the 1970s; history of the
            usage, maintenance, and physical improvements made to Page Auditorium; and records of
            the first fifteen years of the Mary Lou Williams Jazz Festival (1983-1998). In various
            files the series also contains information spanning most of the career of Ella Fountain
            Pratt at Duke University; more extensive material about her can be found in the <extref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uafountainella/">Ella Fountain Pratt Papers</extref>. Visual materials in the series
            include blueprints of Page Auditorium, circa 1960, and approximately forty
            black-and-white photographs of various performers. Files are arranged alphabetically by
            topic.</p>
