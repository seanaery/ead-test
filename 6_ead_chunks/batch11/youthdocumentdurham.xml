         <abstract>Youth Document Durham and Durham Works were programs sponsored by Duke University and the Center for Documentary Studies that brought together young people ages 12–16 from diverse Durham communities to document their lives, local history, and contemporary social issues through photography, oral history, and narrative writing. The Youth Document Durham and Durham Works project records span the years 1995-2008 and document the process of training young people in Durham, North Carolina schools to use photography and other arts, oral histories, and writing to record the history and members of their communities and the local issues affecting the students' lives. Many of the students are African American or Hispanic and their topics often highlight social conditions and race relations in African American and Hispanic communities in Durham neighborhoods and in a few other locations, including South Carolina. Topics explored by participants, both interviewers and interviewees, include crime, food cultures, jobs and education, music, racism, technology, teen violence, work cultures, and tobacco cultivation and its social context. The bulk of the collection is made up of hundreds of oral interviews conducted by junior high and high school students with community members, documented through audiocassette recordings, photographs, writings, and some transcripts, but there are also many program publications, project curricula, and administrative records for the program from its beginnings through 2008. There is also a database created by Center for Documentary Studies staff that records the complete information for each interview, including descriptive notes on certain interviews. This data also contains restricted information. For access to this database, please consult with a reference archivist. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

         <p>Part of the larger Community Programs department in the Center for Documentary Studies, "Youth Document Durham" was a summer program that brought together young people, ages 12–16, from diverse Durham and surrounding communities to document their lives, local history, and contemporary social issues through photography, oral history, and narrative writing. Many of the students are African American or Hispanic and their topics often highlight social conditions and race relations in African American and Hispanic communities in their neighborhoods. Topics explored by participants, both interviewers and interviewees, include crime, food cultures, jobs and education, music, racism, technology, teen violence, work cultures, and tobacco cultivation and its social context.</p>
         
         
         <p>For four intensive weeks, students learned the skills to create photographic bodies of work with a manual camera, the techniques required to process film and develop prints, interviewing skills, computer-based audio editing, and how to write narration reflecting their experiences. They also made decisions about how they would explore their group's topic; they chose who they might want to interview, where and what they would photograph, and what project or event might reflect their work so that they could then share their ideas, stories, and photographs with the larger community. The program produced public forums, web sites, exhibits, and publications. The Youth Document Durham program received funding support from the City of Durham and the Triangle Community Foundation, through the Quintiles Give Back Fund and the Fund for Women and Girls of Durham. Originally called "Community Stories," it is sometimes referred to it in this way in the collection.</p>
         
         
         <p>Also part of Community Programs, Durham Works was an after-school career exploration program that encouraged young people to focus on questions about education, jobs, and the world of work. Using cameras and tape recorders, middle-school students met with community members who were working in jobs that the young people found intriguing and appealing. Their documentary work was presented back to the community in various ways, including exhibits, videos, art installations, and posters.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The Youth Document Durham and Durham Works program records span the years 1995-2008 and document the process of training young people in Durham, North Carolina schools to use photography and other arts, oral histories, and writing to record the histories and members of their communities and the local issues affecting the students' lives. Although the vast majority of the projects focus on Durham, there is also one project based in South Carolina. Topics explored by participants, both interviewers and interviewees, include crime, food cultures, jobs and education, music, racism, technology, teen violence, work cultures, and tobacco cultivation and its social context. The collection is divided into four series: <emph render="bold">Interviews, Photographic Material, Project Files,</emph> and <emph render="bold">Additions</emph>.</p>
         
         
         <p>The bulk of the collection is made up of hundreds of interviews conducted by junior high and high school students with community members, but there are also many program publications, project curricula, and administrative records for those years. The contents of each series is described in full below. There is also a Community Stories database that houses the complete information for each interview, including descriptive notes on certain interviews, and restricted information. For access to this database, please consult with a reference archivist.</p>
         
         
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Interviews Series</emph> forms the bulk of the collection, and houses the materials generated by the student projects. Each session was organized around a topic which usually would be repeated in subsequent years, such as <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Durham Works</title> or <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Old Five Points.</title> Folders usually house one set of interviews conducted by one or more students, and contents typically consist of one or more cassette tapes of the oral interviews, consent forms and other documentation about the interviewees, and writings by the students that came out of their experiences as interviewers. Some interviews have been transcribed. Original audiovisual materials are closed to use; viewing or listening copies need to be made before contents can be accessed. Folders are arranged in number order as assigned by Center for Documentary Studies Staff; they are not in chronological order. An alternate listing at the end of this collection inventory groups boxes by project title rather than folder number order.</p>
         
         
         <p>In addition to oral histories and writings, the students also produced many images of their subjects and their communities. Photographic prints and negatives of their work are housed in the <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph>. Students also produced poems and drawings, and these are chiefly found in the Project Files Series.</p>
         
         
         <p>Supporting program materials - curriculum guides, notes on staff meetings, staff guidelines, assessments of outcomes - are found in the <emph render="bold">Project Files Series</emph>. Also housed here are additional photographic images, mostly of the project students and staff, CDs with final projects, and the many publications that came out of the Center for Documentary Studies program. These booklets contain mostly interview transcriptions but also include photographs, drawings, annotations, and poetry. Also included is a retrospective collection of Youth Document Durham participant photos and essays, edited by Hong-An Truong and published in 2005.</p>
         
         
         <p>Later accessions to the collections are found in the <emph render="bold">Additions Series</emph>. These items consist of audiovisual materials, photographs, and some printed materials. In addition to the Youth Document Durham project, related projects included in the Additions series are the Youth Treatment Court, which seems to have been a division of Youth Document Durham, and the Connect Program, which included projects from Old Five Points as well as special group projects for youth.</p>

               <p>Folders house materials from interviews conducted by students with community members.  The interviews focused on specific program themes relevant to the communities being studied.  The documentary project "Community Stories" describes neighborhood communities mainly in Durham, North Carolina but also in other cities including Wilson, North Carolina and Summerton, South Carolina.  The interviews were recorded on audiocassette tapes which are sometimes but not always accompanied by typed or hand-written transcriptions and student notes.  The folder titles and database information from which other information was taken sometimes do not reveal the project name; when known, the project appears first.</p>
               
               
               <p>The interview materials are often but not always accompanied by an interview agreement form, which the interviewees and interviewers have both signed to allow for the release of their interviews for public use. For interviews with no release forms, researchers are responsible for obtaining permissions to publish.</p>

               <p>A visual narration of "Community Stories" through the original photography of Youth Document Durham participants. Images focus on specific topics chosen by the program staff for each session. The series is separated into two subseries: <emph render="bold">Contact Sheets and Negatives</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Photographic Prints</emph>. The first contains contact sheets and scanned negative images from 2000-2006. The second subseries contains photographic prints from 1996 to 2006, but other materials can be found with these prints, including contact sheets and scanned negative images from 1997-1999. All are arranged in chronological order by program session.</p>
               
               
               <p>Other photographs and associated a/v materials can be found in the <emph render="bold">Project Files Series</emph>, chiefly in the Exhibits and Project Subseries.</p>

                  <p>Boxes contain office files belonging to the program staff, chiefly comprised of staff meeting notes, applications and other forms, participant lists, itineraries, activities and lesson plans, reading materials, and some assignments. These boxes also contained five CDs housing YDD program files, one for each year, and five MDs of audio and one digital DV of student work from various programs. Additionally, one CD contains files from the early Community Stories projects of 1995 and 1999. Discs have been separated from the collection and the files mounted to a server. Arranged chronologically by year and within alphabetically by session name if applicable.</p>

                  <p>Files contain promotional materials for Youth Document Durham and Youth Noise Network programs and exhibitions (one folder), and photographic prints, slides, negatives, and contact sheets that document the students' final displays (ten folders). The slides include not only the exhibit layout and opening, but also contain the student's own images used in the exhibit. There is one set of 84 8x10 and 5x7 inch prints (three folders) used in the <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">Together in our Neighborhood/Juntos con Nuestra Herencia</title> exhibit in 1999.  Printed snapshots, news clippings and other publicity also accompany project materials.  DVDs and CDs, separated from the collection and mounted on a library server, contain digital movies, audio, images, and text from student final projects and exhibits from 2005-2006. </p>
