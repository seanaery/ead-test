         <abstract>Rena Bartos worked as a
		  marketing researcher, advertising executive, and consultant from 1960 to 1998.
		  She directed research at the McCann Erickson advertising agency and held the
		  position of Senior Vice President at the J. Walter Thompson Company before
		  forming her own marketing consulting firm, The Rena Bartos Company. A pioneer
		  in the field of marketing to women and an advocate for older adult consumers,
		  Bartos was the recipient of numerous prestigous marketing and advertising
		  industry awards, including the Matrix and Effie Awards.  The Rena Bartos Papers consists of
		  speeches and presentations, publications, research, and correspondence related
		  to Bartos' career in the marketing research divisions of McCann Erickson and
		  the J. Walter Thompson Company, spanning the years 1960-1998, with the bulk of
		  the contents from 1975-1991. Other items in the collection include video and
		  audio copies of speeches and presentations by Bartos, a brief history of the J.
		  Walter Thompson Company, as well as drafts of articles and manuscripts.
