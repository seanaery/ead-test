         <abstract>Economist and faculty member of Washington University in Saint Louis, Mo., and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993. The papers of university professor and Nobel Prize-winning economist Douglass C. North date from 1942-2006 and consist chiefly of professional correspondence written and received by North, writings by North and other colleagues (the largest group), and files on conferences attended by North; there are also some teaching materials. The collection documents North's career as an economist and professor at Berkeley, University of Washington, Rice University, and Washington University (Missouri), and reflects his interests in Keynesian economics, the economic history of the western world, industrialization, transaction costs, economic development, institutional change, and economics and technology. Among the correspondents are many noted economists, among whom Yoram Barzel, Robert Bates, Reuven Brenner, Robert Clower, R. H. Coase, Robert Fogel, Robert Haveman, Robert Keohane, Simon Kuznets, Deirdre N. McCloskey, Elinor Ostrom, Vernon Smith, and T. N. Srinivasan. </abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p> The papers of university professor and Nobel Prize-winning economist Douglass C. North span the dates 1942-2006, with most of the papers being dated between 1970 and 2000. They consist chiefly of professional correspondence written and received by North, writings by North and other colleagues, and files on conferences attended by North. There are also materials relating to courses he taught. The collection documents North's career as an economist and professor at Berkeley, University of Washington, Rice University, and Washington University (Missouri), and reflects his interests in Keynesian economics, the economic history of the western world, industrialization, transaction costs, economic development, and economics and technology. More specifically, the papers document his long-standing interest in explaining institutional change and political economies without relying exclusively on neo-classical economic theories.</p>
         
         
         <p>Among the correspondents are many noted economists, including Yoram Barzel, Robert Bates, Reuven Brenner, Robert Clower, R.H. Coase, Robert Fogel, Robert Haveman, Robert Keohane, Simon Kuznets, Deirdre N. McCloskey, Elinor Ostrom, Vernon Smith, and T.N. Srinivasan. Some of these correspondents are also represented in the Writings Series of this collection, a large group which contains drafts, notes, and reprints of writings by North as well as writings by his colleagues.</p>

               <p>Series consists of incoming and some outgoing correspondence spanning many decades, and is organized chronologically.  Note fields for most entries highlight significant correspondents or topics.  The early correspondence (1950s to 1980) contains mainly departmental correspondence, proposals, conference invitations, and research exchanges, especially with departmental colleague and collaborator Morris David Morris at the University of Washington. From the 1980s on, files chiefly contain recommendation letters, academic appointments, invitations, workshops, proposals, and reports as well as other routine academic correspondence. In a few cases, manuscripts of book chapters, papers or abstracts are attached to correspondence. Prominent correspondents include Robert Fogel, Amatya Sen, Vernon Smith, George Stigler, Oliver E. Williamson and Herman Wold. </p>
               
               
               <p>Folders are organized by date. For most of the early correspondence, there is one folder for each year. In later years, there is mostly one folder for each month. In later years North also titled some folders according to a particular subject or organization.</p>

               <p>Files document North's active participation in conferences and lectures chiefly from the 1960s to 2002. Many of the conference programs concern economic history, economic growth, and institutional change. In addition to correspondence and schedules related to conference and travel planning, files often contain drafts of lectures given by North or notes he took during conference proceedings. Arranged chronologically.</p>

               <p>This small series of files contains an assortment of documents. Highlights include a set of North's notes from research and consultancy trips to Brazil and Venezuela; North's work for the Bradley Foundation, the Task Force on Economic Transition (1997), Microsoft, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; lecture notes from various events; and records of other professional service. One file group of correspondence, notes, and writings is related to North's intense involvement with a working group who, under the auspices of the Committee on Basic Research of the National Research Council, ultimately published a report entitled <title xlink:type="simple" render="doublequote">The Emergence of Social, Political, and Economic Institutions</title>. The series also contains North's vita from 2000. Folder titles are original and the earliest dated item in the collection, an announcement of North's dissertation program, 1942. Arranged alphabetically by folder title.</p>
