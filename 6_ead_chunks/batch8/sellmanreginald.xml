         <abstract>Amateur photographer and physician from Baltimore, Maryland. Collection consists of 898 nitrate negative images and two prints with images taken by amateur photographer Reginald Sellman from 1911 to 1935, chiefly in Baltimore, Maryland and environs. Subjects include Susie Ford, his wife Obedience (Bedie) Darden Sellman, and their son Bruce Darden Sellman; places featured include Baltimore buildings, streets, bridges, railway stations, monuments, parks, hospitals, and medical teaching institutions.  Institutions include Johns Hopkins and the Bielder-Sellman Sanatorium, founded by Reginald Sellman's father, William A. B. Sellman.  There are images of residences in or near Baltimore where Reginald and Susie Sellman lived. There are many snapshots of family members, and shots taken during hikes, camping trips, and visits to parks.  Maryland locations include Baltimore County historic sites and parks: the Owing's Mills area, Gwynn's Falls, Chatalonee, Loch Raven, Druid Lake, the Chesapeake's Eastern Shore, Elk River, and the Patapsco River.  The Sellmans often visited relatives in North Carolina; thus, there are also many images taken in early 20th century Beaufort, Goldsboro, La Grange, Kinston, and Raleigh. Some feature commercial fishing scenes and cotton transport. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         
         
         <p>Reginald Oliver Sellman (b. 1884 Dec. 12) was the only son of Baltimore physician and gynecologist William Alfred Belt Sellman and his wife Mary Oliver Sellman.  Reginald attended Johns Hopkins University and received a Bachelor's of Arts Degree there in 1908, and an M.D in 1912.  Shortly after he was a resident physician at the Bielder-Sellman Sanatorium, and later was listed as a physician on Charles St.  Susie Ford, who appears in many of the photos before 1914, is mentioned often as "my darling."  Reginald took a next-to-last picture of her in 1914, and her gravesite (with no visible date) is also in the images.  As her monument initials are "S.F.S.," Susie may have been married to Sellman and may have died in 1914.  Sellman married Obedience "Bedie" Darden Sellman, who first appears in nursing school commencement photos, sometime after 1914, and they had a son, Bruce Darden Sellman, born in 1919.  In 1942, at the age of 58, Sellman attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army.  The date or place of his death is unknown.</p><!-- Use Chronlist Tags clip here for Chronology -->

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         
         
         <p>The collection consists of 898 nitrate negatives and two small prints with images taken by amateur photographer and Baltimore resident Reginald Sellman from 1911 to 1935.  They were originally stored in four black cases, one of which has been retained for the collection, and they were meticulously indexed using handwritten cards.  The images are arranged in original chronological order and listed by the photographer's original identification number has been retained; the titles were also taken from the original index cards. Note:  Nitrate negatives can only be consulted with permission of the Curator of Documentary Arts.</p>
         
         
         <p>The snapshots were chiefly taken in Baltimore, Maryland and Baltimore County, and depict buildings, streets, bridges, railway stations, parks, rivers, and monuments, and many family members, especially Reginald's friend (possibly a fianceé) Susie S. Ford, and later, his wife Obedience, and their son Bruce.  There are quite a few photographs taken on day trips to historic sites and parks in Baltimore County such as St. Thomas Episcopal Church, Chattalonee, Gwynn Falls, Owings Mills, Massey, and Lake Roland.  Sellman clearly enjoyed being outside; there are many images of activities such as camping, hiking, and visiting parks and Eastern Shore recreation areas.</p>
         
         
         <p> Reginald's father, William A. B. Sellman, was a noted Baltimore gynecologist and founder of a sanatorium in Baltimore, thus there are views of hospitals (most views are labeled as "B.S.S.," almost certainly the Bielder-Sellman Sanatorium on Charles St.); a few interior shots of the "B.S.S." include an operating room.  There are also exterior views of medical teaching institutions such as Johns Hopkins Hospital.  In one of the two positive prints in the collection, Susie Ford is shown wearing a nurse's uniform.</p>
         
         
         <p>There are images of apartment buildings and houses where Reginald and other family members lived, and some interior shots of rooms. There are many casual snapshots of family members. Later images depict Sellman's young son, Bruce, as a baby and a toddler, along with his mother, Obedience (Bedie) Darden Sellman (O.D.S.). She first appears in the images as Obedience Cox Darden, at her own commencement at a nursing school in May 1914.</p>
         
         
         <p>Reginald and Obedience Sellman often visited her relatives in North Carolina; thus, there are many series of vacation photographs from the 1920s taken in Raleigh, Beaufort, Goldsboro, La Grange, and Kinston, N.C.  Depicted are train stations, relatives' houses, railroads, street scenes, and businesses, some owned by relatives. A long series features scenes from the Methodist Orphanage in Raleigh, possibly where relatives worked.  Zylpha or Zylphia Darden, a cousing of Bedie's, often appears with the baby Bruce.  There are many scenes from Beaufort, N.C., with commercial fishing, streets, and the waterfront. Other earlier vacation spots Reginald visited with Susie depicted include the Eastern Shore, with Tollchester Beach and its amusement part and piers; Harper's Ferry, W. Va.; and the Blue Ridge, Va. area. The last images from 1935 feature Susie Ford's grave and monument in Mount View Cemetery (undentified state); she probably died in spring 1914.</p>
         
         
         <p>Also in the collection are four sets of handwritten index cards listing each negative's identification number, roll of film and frame, caption, and technical details such as camera settings, exposure, film number, and date when image was developed. The cards are filed at the beginning of each group of negatives represented by the set.  One original black storage case has also been retained, as well as advertisement and leaflets featuring photographic supplies, and an envelope of paper corner mounts. Apparently, Sellman also photographed with glass plates, but these are not present in the collection.  There were also several places in the storage case where the film negatives were missing; these are noted in the finding aid.</p>

               <p>A collection of 898 black-and-white nitrate negatives representing urban scenes in Baltimore, rural scenes in Maryland (particularly Baltimore County), snapshots of family members, and recreational areas around the Eastern Shore and the Chesapeake watershed, in Virginia and West Virginia, and in North Carolina towns where relatives of the Sellmans lived.  Arranged in original chronological order.  Titles, numerical identifiers, and dates are taken from Sellman's handwritten card indexes, also included in the collection, and most likely reflect the date the image was taken with the exception of some images dated from the 1930s. Sellman often used abbreviations for family members' names - most of these have been spelled out for the user. </p>

A stamped date is also present, probably date of printing, "Feb 24 1933."  B.S.S. almost certainly refers to the Bielder-Sellman Sanatorium on Charles Street in Baltimore, founded by Sellman's father William A. B. Sellman, and where Reginald was a resident physician starting in 1912.</unittitle>
